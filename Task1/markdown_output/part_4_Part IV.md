# Part IV

## Chapter 1

‘C
an this be still a dream?’v Raskolnikov thought once 
more.
He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected 
visitor.
‘Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!’ he said at last 
aloud in bewilderment.
His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclama-
tion.
‘I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I want-
ed to make your personal acquaintance, as I have already 
heard a great deal about you that is interesting and flatter-
ing; secondly, I cherish the hope that you may not refuse to 
assist me in a matter directly concerning the welfare of your 
sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she 
might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced 
against me, but with your assistance I reckon on …’
‘You reckon wrongly,’ interrupted Raskolnikov.
‘They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?’
Raskolnikov made no reply.
‘It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day 
before. Well, let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I 
don’t consider it necessary to justify myself, but kindly tell 
me what was there particularly criminal on my part in all 
this business, speaking without prejudice, with common 
 Crime and Punishment
398
sense?’
Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.
‘That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and 
‘insulted her with my infamous proposals’—is that it? (I am 
anticipating you.) But you’ve only to assume that I, too, am 
a man et nihil humanum … in a word, that I am capable of 
being attracted and falling in love (which does not depend 
on our will), then everything can be explained in the most 
natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I 
myself a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing 
to the object of my passion to elope with me to America or 
Switzerland, I may have cherished the deepest respect for 
her and may have thought that I was promoting our mutual 
happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, 
probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!’
‘But that’s not the point,’ Raskolnikov interrupted with 
disgust. ‘It’s simply that whether you are right or wrong, we 
dislike you. We don’t want to have anything to do with you. 
We show you the door. Go out!’
Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.
‘But you’re … but there’s no getting round you,’ he said, 
laughing in the frankest way. ‘I hoped to get round you, but 
you took up the right line at once!’
‘But you are trying to get round me still!’
‘What of it? What of it?’ cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing 
openly. ‘But this is what the French call bonne guerre and 
the most innocent form of deception! … But still you have 
interrupted me; one way or another, I repeat again: there 
would never have been any unpleasantness except for what 
 399happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna …’
‘You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?’ 
Raskolnikov interrupted rudely.
‘Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, 
though…. But as for your question, I really don’t know what 
to say, though my own conscience is quite at rest on that 
score. Don’t suppose that I am in any apprehension about it. 
All was regular and in order; the medical inquiry diagnosed 
apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner 
and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved noth-
ing else. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself 
of late, on my way here in the train, especially: didn’t I con-
tribute to all that … calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation 
or something of the sort. But I came to the conclusion that 
that, too, was quite out of the question.’
Raskolnikov laughed.
‘I wonder you trouble yourself about it!’
‘But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her 
just twice with a switch—there were no marks even … don’t 
regard me as a cynic, please; I am perfectly aware how atro-
cious it was of me and all that; but I know for certain, too, 
that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased at my, so to say, 
warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to the 
last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been 
forced to sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with 
in the town. Besides, she had bored them so with that letter 
(you heard about her reading the letter). And all of a sud-
den those two switches fell from heaven! Her first act was 
to order the carriage to be got out…. Not to speak of the 
 Crime and Punishment
400
fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to 
be insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There 
are instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, 
indeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that? 
But it’s particularly so with women. One might even say it’s 
their only amusement.’
At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walk-
ing out and so finishing the interview. But some curiosity 
and even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment.
‘You are fond of fighting?’ he asked carelessly.
‘No, not very,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. ‘And Marfa 
Petrovna and I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmo-
niously, and she was always pleased with me. I only used 
the whip twice in all our seven years (not counting a third 
occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first time, 
two months after our marriage, immediately after we ar-
rived in the country, and the last time was that of which we 
are speaking. Did you suppose I was such a monster, such 
a reactionary, such a slave driver? Ha, ha! By the way, do 
you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, 
in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve for-
gotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the 
papers, for having thrashed a German woman in the rail-
way train. You remember? It was in those days, that very 
year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the Age’ took place 
(you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading, you 
remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of 
our youth, where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who 
thrashed the German, I feel no sympathy with him, because 
 401after all what need is there for sympathy? But I must say 
that there are sometimes such provoking ‘Germans’ that I 
don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer 
for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of 
view then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I as-
sure you.’
After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh 
again. Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a 
firm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself.
‘I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?’ he 
asked.
‘Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my be-
ing such an adaptable man?’
‘No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a 
man.’
‘Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your ques-
tions? Is that it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I 
answered,’ he replied, with a surprising expression of sim-
plicity. ‘You know, there’s hardly anything I take interest in,’ 
he went on, as it were dreamily, ‘especially now, I’ve nothing 
to do…. You are quite at liberty to imagine though that I am 
making up to you with a motive, particularly as I told you 
I want to see your sister about something. But I’ll confess 
frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especial-
ly, so I am delighted to see you…. Don’t be angry, Rodion 
Romanovitch, but you seem to be somehow awfully strange 
yourself. Say what you like, there’s something wrong with 
you, and now, too … not this very minute, I mean, but now, 
generally…. Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl! I am 
 Crime and Punishment
402
not such a bear, you know, as you think.’
Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.
‘You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,’ he said. ‘I fancy in-
deed that you are a man of very good breeding, or at least 
know how on occasion to behave like one.’
‘I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opin-
ion,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, dryly and even with a shade 
of haughtiness, ‘and therefore why not be vulgar at times 
when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our climate … 
and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,’ he 
added, laughing again.
‘But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as 
they say, ‘not without connections.’ What can you want 
with me, then, unless you’ve some special object?’
‘That’s true that I have friends here,’ Svidrigaïlov admit-
ted, not replying to the chief point. ‘I’ve met some already. 
I’ve been lounging about for the last three days, and I’ve 
seen them, or they’ve seen me. That’s a matter of course. I 
am well dressed and reckoned not a poor man; the emanci-
pation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property consists 
chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not 
fallen off; but … I am not going to see them, I was sick of 
them long ago. I’ve been here three days and have called on 
no one…. What a town it is! How has it come into existence 
among us, tell me that? A town of officials and students of 
all sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t notice when I was 
here eight years ago, kicking up my heels…. My only hope 
now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!’
‘Anatomy?’
 403‘But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, 
indeed, maybe —well, all that can go on without me,’ he 
went on, again without noticing the question. ‘Besides, who 
wants to be a card-sharper?’
‘Why, have you been a card-sharper then?’
‘How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, 
men of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. 
And all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property. 
And indeed as a rule in our Russian society the best manners 
are found among those who’ve been thrashed, have you no-
ticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get into 
prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Ne-
zhin. Then Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with 
him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces (I 
owed seventy thousand). We were united in lawful wedlock 
and she bore me off into the country like a treasure. You 
know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of 
me. For seven years I never left the country. And, take note, 
that all my life she held a document over me, the IOU for 
thirty thousand roubles, so if I were to elect to be restive 
about anything I should be trapped at once! And she would 
have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in that.’
‘If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the 
slip?’
‘I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document 
restrained me. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. Mar-
fa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing I was 
bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always felt sick 
there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the 
 Crime and Punishment
404
sea—you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most 
revolting is that one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. 
Here at least one blames others for everything and excuses 
oneself. I should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the 
North Pole, because j’ai le vin mauvais and hate drinking, 
and there’s nothing left but wine. I have tried it. But, I say, 
I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sun-
day from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers 
at a fee. Is it true?’
‘Why, would you go up?’
‘I … No, oh, no,’ muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to 
be deep in thought.
‘What does he mean? Is he in earnest?’ Raskolnikov won-
dered.
‘No, the document didn’t restrain me,’ Svidrigaïlov went 
on, meditatively. ‘It was my own doing, not leaving the 
country, and nearly a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back 
the document on my name- day and made me a present of 
a considerable sum of money, too. She had a fortune, you 
know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’— that 
was actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? 
But do you know I managed the estate quite decently, they 
know me in the neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Mar-
fa Petrovna at first approved, but afterwards she was afraid 
of my over-studying.’
‘You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?’
‘Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the 
way, do you believe in ghosts?’
‘What ghosts?’
 405‘Why, ordinary ghosts.’
‘Do you believe in them?’
‘Perhaps not, pour vous plaire…. I wouldn’t say no ex-
actly.’
‘Do you see them, then?’
Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.
‘Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,’ he said, twisting 
his mouth into a strange smile.
‘How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?’
‘She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day 
of the funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day 
before I left to come here. The second time was the day be-
fore yesterday, at daybreak, on the journey at the station of 
Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in 
the room where I am staying. I was alone.’
‘Were you awake?’
‘Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, 
speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door—always 
at the door. I can almost hear her.’
‘What made me think that something of the sort must be 
happening to you?’ Raskolnikov said suddenly.
At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. 
He was much excited.
‘What! Did you think so?’ Svidrigaïlov asked in astonish-
ment. ‘Did you really? Didn’t I say that there was something 
in common between us, eh?’
‘You never said so!’ Raskolnikov cried sharply and with 
heat.
‘Didn’t I?’
 Crime and Punishment
406
‘No!’
‘I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with 
your eyes shut, pretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s 
the man.’’
‘What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking 
about?’ cried Raskolnikov.
‘What do I mean? I really don’t know….’ Svidrigaïlov 
muttered ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.
For a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s 
faces.
‘That’s all nonsense!’ Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. 
‘What does she say when she comes to you?’
‘She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles 
and—man is a strange creature—it makes me angry. The 
first time she came in (I was tired you know: the funeral 
service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch afterwards. At last 
I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and began to 
think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day, 
Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the din-
ing- room clock,’ she said. All those seven years I’ve wound 
that clock every week, and if I forgot it she would always 
remind me. The next day I set off on my way here. I got out 
at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out, with 
my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up 
and there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me 
with a pack of cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune 
for the journey, Arkady Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand 
at telling fortunes. I shall never forgive myself for not ask-
ing her to. I ran away in a fright, and, besides, the bell rang. 
 407I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a miserable 
dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sud-
den Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new 
green silk dress with a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Iva-
novitch! How do you like my dress? Aniska can’t make like 
this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our 
former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty 
wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the 
dress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. 
‘I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Mar-
fa Petrovna.’ ‘Good gracious, you won’t let one disturb you 
about anything!’ To tease her I said, ‘I want to get married, 
Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you, Arkady Ivanovitch; it 
does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when 
you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a 
good choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happi-
ness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good 
people.’ Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle. 
Isn’t it nonsense, eh?’
‘But perhaps you are telling lies?’ Raskolnikov put in.
‘I rarely lie,’ answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, appar-
ently not noticing the rudeness of the question.
‘And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?’
‘Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six 
years ago. I had a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called 
out forgetting ‘Filka, my pipe!’ He came in and went to the 
cupboard where my pipes were. I sat still and thought ‘he 
is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a violent quarrel 
just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole in 
 Crime and Punishment
408
your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and 
went out, and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petro-
vna at the time. I wanted to have a service sung for him, but 
I was ashamed.’
‘You should go to a doctor.’
‘I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I 
don’t know what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong 
as you are. I didn’t ask you whether you believe that ghosts 
are seen, but whether you believe that they exist.’
‘No, I won’t believe it!’ Raskolnikov cried, with positive 
anger.
‘What do people generally say?’ muttered Svidrigaïlov, as 
though speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his 
head. ‘They say, ‘You are ill, so what appears to you is only 
unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not strictly logical. I agree that 
ghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they 
are unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don’t 
exist.’
‘Nothing of the sort,’ Raskolnikov insisted irritably.
‘No? You don’t think so?’ Svidrigaïlov went on, looking 
at him deliberately. ‘But what do you say to this argument 
(help me with it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and frag-
ments of other worlds, the beginning of them. A man in 
health has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is 
above all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of 
completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon 
as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the or-
ganism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of 
another world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer 
 409becomes one’s contact with that other world, so that as soon 
as the man dies he steps straight into that world. I thought 
of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you could be-
lieve in that, too.’
‘I don’t believe in a future life,’ said Raskolnikov.
Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.
‘And what if there are only spiders there, or something of 
that sort,’ he said suddenly.
‘He is a madman,’ thought Raskolnikov.
‘We always imagine eternity as something beyond our 
conception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? 
Instead of all that, what if it’s one little room, like a bath 
house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every 
corner, and that’s all eternity is? I sometimes fancy it like 
that.’
‘Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more 
comforting than that?’ Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of 
anguish.
‘Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and 
do you know it’s what I would certainly have made it,’ an-
swered Svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile.
This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskol-
nikov. Svidrigaïlov raised his head, looked at him, and 
suddenly began laughing.
‘Only think,’ he cried, ‘half an hour ago we had never 
seen each other, we regarded each other as enemies; there 
is a matter unsettled between us; we’ve thrown it aside, and 
away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t I right in saying 
that we were birds of a feather?’
 Crime and Punishment
410
‘Kindly allow me,’ Raskolnikov went on irritably, ‘to ask 
you to explain why you have honoured me with your visit … 
and … and I am in a hurry, I have no time to waste. I want 
to go out.’
‘By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Ro-
manovna, is going to be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr 
Petrovitch?’
‘Can you refrain from any question about my sister and 
from mentioning her name? I can’t understand how you 
dare utter her name in my presence, if you really are Svid-
rigaïlov.’
‘Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I 
avoid mentioning her?’
‘Very good, speak, but make haste.’
‘I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion 
of this Mr. Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my 
wife, if you have only seen him for half an hour, or heard any 
facts about him. He is no match for Avdotya Romanovna. 
I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing herself gener-
ously and imprudently for the sake of … for the sake of her 
family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would 
be very glad if the match could be broken off without the 
sacrifice of worldly advantages. Now I know you personally, 
I am convinced of it.’
‘All this is very naïve … excuse me, I should have said im-
pudent on your part,’ said Raskolnikov.
‘You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t 
be uneasy, Rodion Romanovitch, if I were working for my 
own advantage, I would not have spoken out so directly. I 
 411am not quite a fool. I will confess something psychologically 
curious about that: just now, defending my love for Avdotya 
Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell 
you that I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that 
I wonder myself indeed, for I really did feel something …’
‘Through idleness and depravity,’ Raskolnikov put in.
‘I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has 
such qualities that even I could not help being impressed by 
them. But that’s all nonsense, as I see myself now.’
‘Have you seen that long?’
‘I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly 
sure of it the day before yesterday, almost at the moment 
I arrived in Petersburg. I still fancied in Moscow, though, 
that I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna’s hand 
and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.’
‘Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and 
come to the object of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to 
go out …’
‘With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and de-
termining on a certain … journey, I should like to make 
some necessary preliminary arrangements. I left my chil-
dren with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have 
no need of me personally. And a nice father I should make, 
too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me 
a year ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just com-
ing to the point. Before the journey which may come off, 
I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It’s not that I detest him 
so much, but it was through him I quarrelled with Marfa 
Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this mar-
 Crime and Punishment
412
riage. I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your 
mediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to 
her that in the first place she will never gain anything but 
harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging her pardon for all 
past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand 
roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture 
to which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could 
see the way to it.’
‘You are certainly mad,’ cried Raskolnikov not so much 
angered as astonished. ‘How dare you talk like that!’
‘I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, 
though I am not rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly 
free; I have absolutely no need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna 
does not accept it, I shall waste it in some more foolish way. 
That’s the first thing. Secondly, my conscience is perfect-
ly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive. You may 
not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you 
will know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, 
whom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, 
and so, sincerely regretting it, I want—not to compensate, 
not to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do 
something to her advantage, to show that I am not, after all, 
privileged to do nothing but harm. If there were a millionth 
fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made 
it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thou-
sand only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I 
may, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone 
ought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Ro-
manovna. In conclusion, let me say that in marrying Mr. 
 413Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from an-
other man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it 
over coolly and quietly.’
Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as 
he was saying this.
‘I beg you to say no more,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘In any case 
this is unpardonable impertinence.’
‘Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm 
to his neighbour in this world, and is prevented from do-
ing the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities. 
That’s absurd. If I died, for instance, and left that sum to 
your sister in my will, surely she wouldn’t refuse it?’
‘Very likely she would.’
‘Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though 
ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. 
In any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya 
Romanovna.’
‘No, I won’t.’
‘In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to 
try and see her myself and worry her by doing so.’
‘And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?’
‘I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much 
to see her once more.’
‘Don’t hope for it.’
‘I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may be-
come better friends.’
‘You think we may become friends?’
‘And why not?’ Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up 
and took his hat. ‘I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and 
 Crime and Punishment
414
I came here without reckoning on it … though I was very 
much struck by your face this morning.’
‘Where did you see me this morning?’ Raskolnikov asked 
uneasily.
‘I saw you by chance…. I kept fancying there is some-
thing about you like me…. But don’t be uneasy. I am not 
intrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and 
I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a 
distant relation of mine, and I could write about Rapha-
el’s Madonna in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left 
Marfa Petrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the 
night at Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old 
days, and I may go up in a balloon with Berg, perhaps.’
‘Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may 
I ask?’
‘What travels?’
‘Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.’
‘A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s 
a wide subject…. if only you knew what you are asking,’ he 
added, and gave a sudden, loud, short laugh. ‘Perhaps I’ll 
get married instead of the journey. They’re making a match 
for me.’
‘Here?’
‘Yes.’
‘How have you had time for that?’
‘But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. 
I earnestly beg it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I 
have forgotten something. Tell your sister, Rodion Roma-
novitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered her in her will 
 415and left her three thousand roubles. That’s absolutely cer-
tain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, 
and it was done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will 
be able to receive the money in two or three weeks.’
‘Are you telling the truth?’
‘Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near 
you.’
As he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin 
in the doorway.

## Chapter 2

I
t was nearly eight o’clock. The two young men hurried to 
Bakaleyev’s, to arrive before Luzhin.
‘Why, who was that?’ asked Razumihin, as soon as they 
were in the street.
‘It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my 
sister was insulted when she was their governess. Through 
his persecuting her with his attentions, she was turned out 
by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This Marfa Petrovna begged 
Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just died sud-
denly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don’t 
know why I’m afraid of that man. He came here at once af-
ter his wife’s funeral. He is very strange, and is determined 
on doing something…. We must guard Dounia from him … 
that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you hear?’
‘Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanov-
na? Thank you, Rodya, for speaking to me like that…. We 
will, we will guard her. Where does he live?’
‘I don’t know.’
‘Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.’
‘Did you see him?’ asked Raskolnikov after a pause.
‘Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.’
‘You did really see him? You saw him clearly?’ Raskol-
nikov insisted.
‘Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a 
 417thousand; I have a good memory for faces.’
They were silent again.
‘Hm! … that’s all right,’ muttered Raskolnikov. ‘Do you 
know, I fancied … I keep thinking that it may have been an 
hallucination.’
‘What do you mean? I don’t understand you.’
‘Well, you all say,’ Raskolnikov went on, twisting his 
mouth into a smile, ‘that I am mad. I thought just now that 
perhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom.’
‘What do you mean?’
‘Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and per-
haps everything that happened all these days may be only 
imagination.’
‘Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again! … But what did 
he say, what did he come for?’
Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a min-
ute.
‘Now let me tell you my story,’ he began, ‘I came to you, 
you were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to 
Porfiry’s, Zametov was still with him. I tried to begin, but 
it was no use. I couldn’t speak in the right way. They don’t 
seem to understand and can’t understand, but are not a bit 
ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking 
to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked 
away. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him 
as a cousin I’d brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed 
and came away. That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov 
I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I thought I’d made a mess 
of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why 
 Crime and Punishment
418
should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger or 
anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang 
for them. We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if 
I were in your place I’d mystify them more than ever. How 
ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang them! We can thrash 
them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!’
‘To be sure,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘But what will you 
say to-morrow?’ he thought to himself. Strange to say, till 
that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what 
Razumihin would think when he knew. As he thought it, 
Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his vis-
it to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had 
come and gone since then.
In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived 
punctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so 
that all three went in together without greeting or look-
ing at one another. The young men walked in first, while 
Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the 
passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came 
forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was 
welcoming her brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and 
quite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the 
ladies. He looked, however, as though he were a little put 
out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to 
make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar 
was boiling. Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another 
on opposite sides of the table. Razumihin and Raskolnikov 
were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next 
 419to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.
A moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch delib-
erately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent 
and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt 
himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an ex-
planation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to 
keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two 
ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the 
gravity of the position. But he could not bring himself to 
do this. Besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he 
wanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly 
disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case 
it was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to 
punish them and there would always be time for that.
‘I trust you had a favourable journey,’ he inquired offi-
cially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
‘Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.’
‘I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not 
over-fatigued either?’
‘I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great 
strain for mother,’ answered Dounia.
‘That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible 
length. ‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country…. In 
spite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yes-
terday. But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?’
‘Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheart-
ening,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with 
peculiar intonation, ‘and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been 
sent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have 
 Crime and Punishment
420
been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,’ 
she added, introducing him to Luzhin.
‘I had the pleasure … yesterday,’ muttered Pyotr Petro-
vitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he 
scowled and was silent.
Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on 
the surface very polite in society, who make a great point of 
punctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in any-
thing, are completely disconcerted, and become more like 
sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society. Again 
all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya 
Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too 
soon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna was anxious again.
‘Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?’ she began hav-
ing recourse to her leading item of conversation.
‘To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, 
and I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that 
Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Peters-
burg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So at least I have 
excellent authority for believing.’
‘To Petersburg? here?’ Dounia asked in alarm and looked 
at her mother.
‘Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, 
having in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the cir-
cumstances preceding it.’
‘Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even 
here?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
‘I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna 
 421have any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are 
yourselves desirous of getting into communication with 
him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now discover-
ing where he is lodging.’
‘Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright 
you have given me,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: ‘I’ve 
only seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible! 
I am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna’s 
death.’
‘It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise 
information. I do not dispute that he may have contribut-
ed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, 
so to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and 
moral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement 
with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and pre-
cisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to 
me within a very short period; but no doubt here in Peters-
burg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at 
once into his old ways. He is the most depraved, and abject-
ly vicious specimen of that class of men. I have considerable 
reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfor-
tunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight 
years ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely 
by her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving 
an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which 
he might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed 
up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to know.’
‘Good heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskol-
nikov listened attentively.
 Crime and Punishment
422
‘Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have 
good evidence of this?’ Dounia asked sternly and emphati-
cally.
‘I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. 
I must observe that from the legal point of view the case was 
far from clear. There was, and I believe still is, living here 
a woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums 
of money at interest, and did other commissions, and with 
this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mys-
terious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living 
with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not 
more than fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged 
her every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly. One day 
the girl was found hanging in the garret. At the inquest the 
verdict was suicide. After the usual proceedings the matter 
ended, but, later on, information was given that the child 
had been … cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this 
was not clearly established, the information was given by 
another German woman of loose character whose word 
could not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the 
police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and exertions; it 
did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very signifi-
cant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when 
you were with them the story of the servant Philip who died 
of ill treatment he received six years ago, before the aboli-
tion of serfdom.’
‘I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged him-
self.’
‘Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps dis-
 423posed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and 
severity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov.’
‘I don’t know that,’ answered Dounia, dryly. ‘I only heard 
a queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort 
of domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, ‘he read 
himself silly,’ and that he hanged himself partly on account 
of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not his blows. 
When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they 
were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame 
him for Philip’s death.’
‘I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed 
to undertake his defence all of a sudden,’ Luzhin observed, 
twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, ‘there’s no doubt 
that he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are 
concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so 
strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to 
be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in 
view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be antici-
pated from him. For my part it’s my firm conviction, that he 
will end in a debtor’s prison again. Marfa Petrovna had not 
the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on 
him, having regard for his children’s interests, and, if she 
left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, 
something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not 
last a year for a man of his habits.’
‘Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,’ said Dounia, ‘say no more of 
Mr. Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.’
‘He has just been to see me,’ said Raskolnikov, breaking 
his silence for the first time.
 Crime and Punishment
424
There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to 
him. Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused.
‘An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, 
waked me, and introduced himself,’ Raskolnikov continued. 
‘He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we 
shall become friends. He is particularly anxious, by the way, 
Dounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to 
assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me 
about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa 
Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dou-
nia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.’
‘Thank God!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing 
herself. ‘Pray for her soul, Dounia!’
‘It’s a fact!’ broke from Luzhin.
‘Tell us, what more?’ Dounia urged Raskolnikov.
‘Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was 
left to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he 
was staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don’t 
know, I didn’t ask….’
‘But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?’ 
cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. ‘Did he tell you?’
‘Yes.’
‘What was it?’
‘I’ll tell you afterwards.’
Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention 
to his tea.
Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.
‘I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I 
shall not be in your way,’ he added with an air of some pique 
 425and he began getting up.
‘Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ said Dounia, ‘you intended 
to spend the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you 
wanted to have an explanation with mother.’
‘Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,’ Pyotr Petrovitch an-
swered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding 
his hat. ‘I certainly desired an explanation with you and 
your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed. 
But as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of 
some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not desire and 
am not able to speak openly … in the presence of others 
… of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my 
most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded….’
Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into digni-
fied silence.
‘Your request that my brother should not be present at our 
meeting was disregarded solely at my instance,’ said Dou-
nia. ‘You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I 
think that this must be explained at once, and you must be 
reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you, then he 
should and will apologise.’
Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.
‘There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no good-
will can make us forget. There is a line in everything which 
it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been over-
stepped, there is no return.’
‘That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petro-
vitch,’ Dounia interrupted with some impatience. ‘Please 
understand that our whole future depends now on wheth-
 Crime and Punishment
426
er all this is explained and set right as soon as possible. I 
tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it in any 
other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this 
business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. 
I repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your for-
giveness.’
‘I am surprised at your putting the question like that,’ 
said Luzhin, getting more and more irritated. ‘Esteeming, 
and so to say, adoring you, I may at the same time, very 
well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family. 
Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I cannot 
accept duties incompatible with …’
‘Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ 
Dounia interrupted with feeling, ‘and be the sensible and 
generous man I have always considered, and wish to con-
sider, you to be. I’ve given you a great promise, I am your 
betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe me, I shall 
be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of 
judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When 
I insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your 
letter, I told him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand 
that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you—
it must be either you or he. That is how the question rests 
on your side and on his. I don’t want to be mistaken in my 
choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off
 
with my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with 
you. I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother 
to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear 
to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the hus-
 427band for me.’
‘Avdotya Romanovna,’ Luzhin declared huffily, ‘your 
words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, 
they are offensive in view of the position I have the hon-
our to occupy in relation to you. To say nothing of your 
strange and offensive setting me on a level with an im-
pertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your 
promise to me. You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how 
little consequence I am in your eyes … I cannot let this pass 
considering the relationship and … the obligations existing 
between us.’
‘What!’ cried Dounia, flushing. ‘I set your interest beside 
all that has hitherto been most precious in my life, what has 
made up the whole of my life, and here you are offended at 
my making too little account of you.’
Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, 
but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the con-
trary, at every word he became more persistent and irritable, 
as though he relished it.
‘Love for the future partner of your life, for your hus-
band, ought to outweigh your love for your brother,’ he 
pronounced sententiously, ‘and in any case I cannot be put 
on the same level…. Although I said so emphatically that 
I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence, nev-
ertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a 
necessary explanation on a point of great importance close-
ly affecting my dignity. Your son,’ he turned to Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna, ‘yesterday in the presence of Mr. Razsud-
kin (or … I think that’s it? excuse me I have forgotten your 
 Crime and Punishment
428
surname,’ he bowed politely to Razumihin) ‘insulted me 
by misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private 
conversation, drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a 
poor girl who has had experience of trouble is more advan-
tageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who 
has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable for the moral 
character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the signifi-
cance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing 
me of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied 
upon your correspondence with him. I shall consider my-
self happy, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you 
to convince me of an opposite conclusion, and thereby con-
siderately reassure me. Kindly let me know in what terms 
precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion 
Romanovitch.’
‘I don’t remember,’ faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ‘I 
repeated them as I understood them. I don’t know how Ro-
dya repeated them to you, perhaps he exaggerated.’
‘He could not have exaggerated them, except at your in-
stigation.’
‘Pyotr Petrovitch,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared 
with dignity, ‘the proof that Dounia and I did not take your 
words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here.’
‘Good, mother,’ said Dounia approvingly.
‘Then this is my fault again,’ said Luzhin, aggrieved.
‘Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but 
you yourself have just written what was false about him,’ 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna added, gaining courage.
‘I don’t remember writing anything false.’
 429‘You wrote,’ Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Lu-
zhin, ‘that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the 
man who was killed, as was the fact, but to his daughter 
(whom I had never seen till yesterday). You wrote this to 
make dissension between me and my family, and for that 
object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl 
whom you don’t know. All that is mean slander.’
‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Luzhin, quivering with fury. ‘I en-
larged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely 
in response to your sister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I 
found you, and what impression you made on me. As for 
what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good as to point 
out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t 
throw away your money, and that there are not worthless 
persons in that family, however unfortunate.’
‘To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth 
the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw 
stones.’
‘Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your 
mother and sister?’
‘I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit 
down to-day with mother and Dounia.’
‘Rodya!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crim-
soned, Razumihin knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with 
lofty sarcasm.
‘You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,’ he said, 
‘whether it is possible for us to agree. I hope now that this 
question is at an end, once and for all. I will withdraw, that 
I may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy, and the 
 Crime and Punishment
430
discussion of secrets.’ He got up from his chair and took 
his hat. ‘But in withdrawing, I venture to request that for 
the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to say, 
compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pul-
cheria Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter 
was addressed to you and to no one else.’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.
‘You seem to think we are completely under your author-
ity, Pyotr Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your 
desire was disregarded, she had the best intentions. And in-
deed you write as though you were laying commands upon 
me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as a command? 
Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show par-
ticular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we 
have thrown up everything, and have come here relying on 
you, and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands.’
‘That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, espe-
cially at the present moment, when the news has come of 
Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which seems indeed very apropos, 
judging from the new tone you take to me,’ he added sar-
castically.
‘Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume 
that you were reckoning on our helplessness,’ Dounia ob-
served irritably.
‘But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I par-
ticularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret 
proposals of Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has 
entrusted to your brother and which have, I perceive, a great 
and possibly a very agreeable interest for you.’
 431‘Good heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.
‘Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?’ asked Raskolnikov.
‘I am ashamed, Rodya,’ said Dounia. ‘Pyotr Petrovitch, 
go away,’ she turned to him, white with anger.
Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such 
a conclusion. He had too much confidence in himself, in his 
power and in the helplessness of his victims. He could not 
believe it even now. He turned pale, and his lips quivered.
‘Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after 
such a dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never 
come back. Consider what you are doing. My word is not 
to be shaken.’
‘What insolence!’ cried Dounia, springing up from her 
seat. ‘I don’t want you to come back again.’
‘What! So that’s how it stands!’ cried Luzhin, utterly un-
able to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so 
completely thrown out of his reckoning now. ‘So that’s how 
it stands! But do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, that I 
might protest?’
‘What right have you to speak to her like that?’ Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna intervened hotly. ‘And what can you protest 
about? What rights have you? Am I to give my Dounia to a 
man like you? Go away, leave us altogether! We are to blame 
for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above all….’
‘But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,’ Lu-
zhin stormed in a frenzy, ‘by your promise, and now you 
deny it and … besides … I have been led on account of that 
into expenses….’
 Crime and Punishment
432
This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petro-
vitch, that Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort 
of restraining it, could not help breaking into laughter. But 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was furious.
‘Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our 
trunk? But the conductor brought it for nothing for you. 
Mercy on us, we have bound you! What are you thinking 
about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and foot, 
not we!’
‘Enough, mother, no more please,’ Avdotya Romanovna 
implored. ‘Pyotr Petrovitch, do be kind and go!’
‘I am going, but one last word,’ he said, quite unable to 
control himself. ‘Your mamma seems to have entirely for-
gotten that I made up my mind to take you, so to speak, 
after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district 
in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public opinion 
for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly 
might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might in-
deed look for gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only 
now been opened! I see myself that I may have acted very, 
very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict….’
‘Does the fellow want his head smashed?’ cried Razumi-
hin, jumping up.
‘You are a mean and spiteful man!’ cried Dounia.
‘Not a word! Not a movement!’ cried Raskolnikov, hold-
ing Razumihin back; then going close up to Luzhin, ‘Kindly 
leave the room!’ he said quietly and distinctly, ‘and not a 
word more or …’
Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a 
 433pale face that worked with anger, then he turned, went out, 
and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vin-
dictive hatred as he felt against Raskolnikov. Him, and him 
alone, he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy that as he 
went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps 
not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, 
all might ‘very well indeed’ be set right again.

## Chapter 3

T
he fact was that up to the last moment he had never ex-
pected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the 
last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defence-
less women could escape from his control. This conviction 
was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the 
point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up 
from insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, 
had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, 
and sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in 
the glass. But what he loved and valued above all was the 
money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of de-
vices: that money made him the equal of all who had been 
his superiors.
When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had de-
cided to take her in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had 
spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuine-
ly indignant at such ‘black ingratitude.’ And yet, when he 
made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the ground-
lessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere 
contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbe-
lieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a 
defence. And he would not have denied that he knew all that 
at the time. Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution 
in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as something 
 435heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret 
feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not under-
stand that others should fail to admire it too. He had called 
on Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is 
about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agree-
able flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he considered 
himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.
Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her 
was unthinkable. For many years he had had voluptuous 
dreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amass-
ing money. He brooded with relish, in profound secret, over 
the image of a girl—virtuous, poor (she must be poor), very 
young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, 
one who had suffered much, and was completely humbled 
before him, one who would all her life look on him as her 
saviour, worship him, admire him and only him. How 
many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imag-
ined on this seductive and playful theme, when his work 
was over! And, behold, the dream of so many years was 
all but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Ro-
manovna had impressed him; her helpless position had been 
a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he 
dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of 
education and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), 
and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for 
his heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the 
dust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded 
power over her! … Not long before, he had, too, after long 
reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his 
 Crime and Punishment
436
career and was now entering on a wider circle of business. 
With this change his cherished dreams of rising into a high-
er class of society seemed likely to be realised…. He was, in 
fact, determined to try his fortune in Petersburg. He knew 
that women could do a very great deal. The fascination of a 
charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make 
his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to 
him, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything 
was in ruins! This sudden horrible rupture affected him like 
a clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity. 
He had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time 
to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away 
—and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did 
love Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his 
dreams—and all at once! No! The next day, the very next 
day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. Above 
all he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause 
of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help recalling Ra-
zumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; 
as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! 
The man he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov…. He 
had, in short, a great deal to attend to….
*****
‘No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!’ said Dounia, 
kissing and embracing her mother. ‘I was tempted by his 
money, but on my honour, brother, I had no idea he was 
such a base man. If I had seen through him before, nothing 
would have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!’
‘God has delivered us! God has delivered us!’ Pulcheria 
 437Alexandrovna muttered, but half consciously, as though 
scarcely able to realise what had happened.
They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were 
laughing. Only now and then Dounia turned white and 
frowned, remembering what had passed. Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had 
only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible 
misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare 
to express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as 
though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart. Now he had the 
right to devote his life to them, to serve them…. Anything 
might happen now! But he felt afraid to think of further 
possibilities and dared not let his imagination range. But 
Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and 
indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on get-
ting rid of Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at 
what had happened. Dounia could not help thinking that 
he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
watched him timidly.
‘What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?’ said Dounia, ap-
proaching him.
‘Yes, yes!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
Raskolnikov raised his head.
‘He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles 
and he desires to see you once in my presence.’
‘See her! On no account!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. 
‘And how dare he offer her money!’
Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversa-
tion with Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly 
 Crime and Punishment
438
visitations of Marfa Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unneces-
sary talk.
‘What answer did you give him?’ asked Dounia.
‘At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then 
he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview 
with you without my help. He assured me that his passion 
for you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for 
you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin…. His talk was 
altogether rather muddled.’
‘How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did 
he strike you?’
‘I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers 
you ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says 
he is going away, and in ten minutes he forgets he has said 
it. Then he says is he going to be married and has already 
fixed on the girl…. No doubt he has a motive, and probably 
a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about it if 
he had any designs against you…. Of course, I refused this 
money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought 
him very strange…. One might almost think he was mad. 
But I may be mistaken; that may only be the part he as-
sumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made a 
great impression on him.’
‘God rest her soul,’ exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. 
‘I shall always, always pray for her! Where should we be 
now, Dounia, without this three thousand! It’s as though it 
had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this morning we had 
only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were just 
planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from 
 439that man until he offered help.’
Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s of-
fer. She still stood meditating.
‘He has got some terrible plan,’ she said in a half whisper 
to herself, almost shuddering.
Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.
‘I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,’ he 
said to Dounia.
‘We will watch him! I will track him out!’ cried Razumi-
hin, vigorously. ‘I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given 
me leave. He said to me himself just now. ‘Take care of my 
sister.’ Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?’
Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of 
anxiety did not leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
gazed at her timidly, but the three thousand roubles had 
obviously a soothing effect on her.
A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a 
lively conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively 
for some time, though he did not talk. Razumihin was the 
speaker.
‘And why, why should you go away?’ he flowed on ecstati-
cally. ‘And what are you to do in a little town? The great 
thing is, you are all here together and you need one an-
other—you do need one another, believe me. For a time, 
anyway…. Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll 
plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail 
to you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this 
morning, before anything had happened … I tell you what; 
I have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a most ac-
 Crime and Punishment
440
commodating and respectable old man). This uncle has got 
a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his pension 
and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has 
been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six 
per cent. interest. I know what that means; he simply wants 
to help me. Last year I had no need of it, but this year I re-
solved to borrow it as soon as he arrived. Then you lend me 
another thousand of your three and we have enough for a 
start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going 
to do?’
Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he 
explained at length that almost all our publishers and book-
sellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for 
that reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any 
decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, some-
times a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been 
dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years 
he had been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three 
European languages well, though he had told Raskolnikov 
six days before that he was ‘schwach’ in German with an 
object of persuading him to take half his translation and 
half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and Raskol-
nikov knew he was lying.
‘Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have 
one of the chief means of success—money of our own!’ cried 
Razumihin warmly. ‘Of course there will be a lot of work, 
but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion…. 
You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And the 
great point of the business is that we shall know just what 
 441wants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, 
learning all at once. I can be of use because I have experi-
ence. For nearly two years I’ve been scuttling about among 
the publishers, and now I know every detail of their busi-
ness. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And 
why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know—and 
I kept the secret—two or three books which one might get 
a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and 
publishing. Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for 
the very idea of one of them. And what do you think? If I 
were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate—they are 
such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, pa-
per, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll 
begin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case it will 
get us our living and we shall get back our capital.’
Dounia’s eyes shone.
‘I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!’ she said.
‘I know nothing about it, of course,’ put in Pulcheria Al-
exandrovna, ‘it may be a good idea, but again God knows. 
It’s new and untried. Of course, we must remain here at 
least for a time.’ She looked at Rodya.
‘What do you think, brother?’ said Dounia.
‘I think he’s got a very good idea,’ he answered. ‘Of 
course, it’s too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we 
certainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of 
success. I know of one book myself which would be sure to 
go well. And as for his being able to manage it, there’s no 
doubt about that either. He knows the business…. But we 
can talk it over later….’
 Crime and Punishment
442
‘Hurrah!’ cried Razumihin. ‘Now, stay, there’s a flat here 
in this house, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special 
flat apart, not communicating with these lodgings. It’s fur-
nished, rent moderate, three rooms. Suppose you take them 
to begin with. I’ll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring 
you the money, and everything can be arranged then. You 
can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But 
where are you off to, Rodya?’
‘What, Rodya, you are going already?’ Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna asked in dismay.
‘At such a minute?’ cried Razumihin.
Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous won-
der. He held his cap in his hand, he was preparing to leave 
them.
‘One would think you were burying me or saying good-
bye for ever,’ he said somewhat oddly. He attempted to 
smile, but it did not turn out a smile. ‘But who knows, per-
haps it is the last time we shall see each other …’ he let slip 
accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it somehow 
was uttered aloud.
‘What is the matter with you?’ cried his mother.
‘Where are you going, Rodya?’ asked Dounia rather 
strangely.
‘Oh, I’m quite obliged to …’ he answered vaguely, as 
though hesitating what he would say. But there was a look 
of sharp determination in his white face.
‘I meant to say … as I was coming here … I meant to 
tell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better 
for us to part for a time. I feel ill, I am not at peace…. I will 
 443come afterwards, I will come of myself … when it’s possible. 
I remember you and love you…. Leave me, leave me alone. 
I decided this even before … I’m absolutely resolved on it. 
Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, 
I want to be alone. Forget me altogether, it’s better. Don’t 
inquire about me. When I can, I’ll come of myself or … I’ll 
send for you. Perhaps it will all come back, but now if you 
love me, give me up … else I shall begin to hate you, I feel 
it…. Good-bye!’
‘Good God!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his 
mother and his sister were terribly alarmed. Razumihin 
was also.
‘Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!’ 
cried his poor mother.
He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the 
room. Dounia overtook him.
‘Brother, what are you doing to mother?’ she whispered, 
her eyes flashing with indignation.
He looked dully at her.
‘No matter, I shall come…. I’m coming,’ he muttered in 
an undertone, as though not fully conscious of what he was 
saying, and he went out of the room.
‘Wicked, heartless egoist!’ cried Dounia.
‘He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don’t you see 
it? You’re heartless after that!’ Razumihin whispered in her 
ear, squeezing her hand tightly. ‘I shall be back directly,’ he 
shouted to the horror- stricken mother, and he ran out of 
the room.
Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the pas-
 Crime and Punishment
444
sage.
‘I knew you would run after me,’ he said. ‘Go back to 
them—be with them … be with them to-morrow and al-
ways…. I … perhaps I shall come … if I can. Good-bye.’
And without holding out his hand he walked away.
‘But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s 
the matter with you? How can you go on like this?’ Razu-
mihin muttered, at his wits’ end.
Raskolnikov stopped once more.
‘Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have noth-
ing to tell you. Don’t come to see me. Maybe I’ll come here…. 
Leave me, but don’t leave them. Do you understand me?’
It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the 
lamp. For a minute they were looking at one another in 
silence. Razumihin remembered that minute all his life. Ras-
kolnikov’s burning and intent eyes grew more penetrating 
every moment, piercing into his soul, into his conscious-
ness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as 
it were, passed between them…. Some idea, some hint, as it 
were, slipped, something awful, hideous, and suddenly un-
derstood on both sides…. Razumihin turned pale.
‘Do you understand now?’ said Raskolnikov, his face 
twitching nervously. ‘Go back, go to them,’ he said suddenly, 
and turning quickly, he went out of the house.
I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back 
to the ladies, how he soothed them, how he protested that 
Rodya needed rest in his illness, protested that Rodya was 
sure to come, that he would come every day, that he was 
very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated, that he, 
 445Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, 
the best doctor, a consultation…. In fact from that evening 
Razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother.

## Chapter 4

R
askolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank 
where Sonia lived. It was an old green house of three 
storeys. He found the porter and obtained from him vague 
directions as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor. 
Having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance 
to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second 
floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole 
second storey over the yard. While he was wandering in the 
darkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, 
a door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took 
hold of it.
‘Who is there?’ a woman’s voice asked uneasily.
‘It’s I … come to see you,’ answered Raskolnikov and he 
walked into the tiny entry.
On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper 
candlestick.
‘It’s you! Good heavens!’ cried Sonia weakly, and she 
stood rooted to the spot.
‘Which is your room? This way?’ and Raskolnikov, trying 
not to look at her, hastened in.
A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set 
down the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood 
before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently fright-
ened by his unexpected visit. The colour rushed suddenly 
 447to her pale face and tears came into her eyes … She felt sick 
and ashamed and happy, too…. Raskolnikov turned away 
quickly and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the 
room in a rapid glance.
It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only 
one let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door 
led in the wall on the left. In the opposite side on the right 
hand wall was another door, always kept locked. That led 
to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging. Sonia’s 
room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle 
and this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three 
windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one 
corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see 
in it without very strong light. The other corner was dis-
proportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any furniture 
in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, 
beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table cov-
ered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the 
door into the other flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by 
the table. On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood 
a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, 
lost in a desert. That was all there was in the room. The 
yellow, scratched and shabby wall- paper was black in the 
corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the 
winter. There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead 
had no curtain.
Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so atten-
tively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and 
even began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was 
 Crime and Punishment
448
standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies.
‘I am late…. It’s eleven, isn’t it?’ he asked, still not lifting 
his eyes.
‘Yes,’ muttered Sonia, ‘oh yes, it is,’ she added, hastily, as 
though in that lay her means of escape. ‘My landlady’s clock 
has just struck … I heard it myself….’
‘I’ve come to you for the last time,’ Raskolnikov went on 
gloomily, although this was the first time. ‘I may perhaps 
not see you again …’
‘Are you … going away?’
‘I don’t know … to-morrow….’
‘Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-mor-
row?’ Sonia’s voice shook.
‘I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning…. Never 
mind that: I’ve come to say one word….’
He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed 
that he was sitting down while she was all the while stand-
ing before him.
‘Why are you standing? Sit down,’ he said in a changed 
voice, gentle and friendly.
She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassion-
ately at her.
‘How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like 
a dead hand.’
He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.
‘I have always been like that,’ she said.
‘Even when you lived at home?’
‘Yes.’
‘Of course, you were,’ he added abruptly and the expres-
 449sion of his face and the sound of his voice changed again 
suddenly.
He looked round him once more.
‘You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?’
‘Yes….’
‘They live there, through that door?’
‘Yes…. They have another room like this.’
‘All in one room?’
‘Yes.’
‘I should be afraid in your room at night,’ he observed 
gloomily.
‘They are very good people, very kind,’ answered Sonia, 
who still seemed bewildered, ‘and all the furniture, every-
thing … everything is theirs. And they are very kind and 
the children, too, often come to see me.’
‘They all stammer, don’t they?’
‘Yes…. He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too…. 
It’s not exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plain-
ly. She is a very kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. 
And there are seven children … and it’s only the eldest one 
that stammers and the others are simply ill … but they don’t 
stammer…. But where did you hear about them?’ she added 
with some surprise.
‘Your father told me, then. He told me all about you…. 
And how you went out at six o’clock and came back at nine 
and how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed.’
Sonia was confused.
‘I fancied I saw him to-day,’ she whispered hesitatingly.
‘Whom?’
 Crime and Punishment
450
‘Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the cor-
ner, about ten o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. 
It looked just like him. I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanov-
na….’
‘You were walking in the streets?’
‘Yes,’ Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with 
confusion and looking down.
‘Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?’
‘Oh no, what are you saying? No!’ Sonia looked at him 
almost with dismay.
‘You love her, then?’
‘Love her? Of course!’ said Sonia with plaintive empha-
sis, and she clasped her hands in distress. ‘Ah, you don’t…. 
If you only knew! You see, she is quite like a child…. Her 
mind is quite unhinged, you see … from sorrow. And how 
clever she used to be … how generous … how kind! Ah, you 
don’t understand, you don’t understand!’
Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands 
in excitement and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there 
was a look of anguish in her eyes. It was clear that she was 
stirred to the very depths, that she was longing to speak, 
to champion, to express something. A sort of insatiable 
compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every 
feature of her face.
‘Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if 
she did beat me, what then? What of it? You know nothing, 
nothing about it…. She is so unhappy … ah, how unhap-
py! And ill…. She is seeking righteousness, she is pure. She 
has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere 
 451and she expects it…. And if you were to torture her, she 
wouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for 
people to be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, 
like a child. She is good!’
‘And what will happen to you?’
Sonia looked at him inquiringly.
‘They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on 
your hands before, though…. And your father came to you 
to beg for drink. Well, how will it be now?’
‘I don’t know,’ Sonia articulated mournfully.
‘Will they stay there?’
‘I don’t know…. They are in debt for the lodging, but the 
landlady, I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of 
them, and Katerina Ivanovna says that she won’t stay an-
other minute.’
‘How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?’
‘Oh, no, don’t talk like that…. We are one, we live like 
one.’ Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though 
a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. ‘And 
what could she do? What, what could she do?’ she persist-
ed, getting hot and excited. ‘And how she cried to-day! Her 
mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute 
she is worrying like a child that everything should be right 
to-morrow, the lunch and all that…. Then she is wringing 
her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will 
begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair. Then 
she will be comforted again. She builds all her hopes on 
you; she says that you will help her now and that she will 
borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town 
 Crime and Punishment
452
with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of 
gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin 
a new splendid life. And she kisses and hugs me, comforts 
me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in her fan-
cies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has 
been washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash 
tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the 
bed, gasping for breath. We went this morning to the shops 
to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn 
out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not 
nearly enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, 
for she has taste, you don’t know. And there in the shop 
she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn’t 
enough…. Ah, it was sad to see her….’
‘Well, after that I can understand your living like this,’ 
Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile.
‘And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?’ Sonia 
flew at him again. ‘Why, I know, you gave your last penny 
yourself, though you’d seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen 
everything, oh dear! And how often, how often I’ve brought 
her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only a week before his 
death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah, I’ve been 
wretched at the thought of it all day!’
Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of re-
membering it.
‘You were cruel?’
‘Yes, I—I. I went to see them,’ she went on, weeping, ‘and 
father said, ‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read 
to me, here’s a book.’ He had a book he had got from Andrey 
 453Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used 
to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I can’t stay,’ as 
I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show Kat-
erina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me 
some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. 
Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on 
and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with 
them. ‘Make me a present of them, Sonia,’ she said, ‘please 
do.’ ‘Please do ‘ she said, she wanted them so much. And 
when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her 
old happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired 
herself, and she has no clothes at all, no things of her own, 
hasn’t had all these years! And she never asks anyone for 
anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give away everything. 
And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I was 
sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Iva-
novna?’ I said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have 
said that! She gave me such a look. And she was so grieved, 
so grieved at my refusing her. And it was so sad to see…. 
And she was not grieved for the collars, but for my refus-
ing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back, change it, 
take back those words! Ah, if I … but it’s nothing to you!’
‘Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?’
‘Yes…. Did you know her?’ Sonia asked with some sur-
prise.
‘Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consump-
tion; she will soon die,’ said Raskolnikov after a pause, 
without answering her question.
‘Oh, no, no, no!’
 Crime and Punishment
454
And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as 
though imploring that she should not.
‘But it will be better if she does die.’
‘No, not better, not at all better!’ Sonia unconsciously re-
peated in dismay.
‘And the children? What can you do except take them to 
live with you?’
‘Oh, I don’t know,’ cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she 
put her hands to her head.
It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to 
her before and he had only roused it again.
‘And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, 
you get ill and are taken to the hospital, what will happen 
then?’ he persisted pitilessly.
‘How can you? That cannot be!’
And Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.
‘Cannot be?’ Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. 
‘You are not insured against it, are you? What will happen 
to them then? They will be in the street, all of them, she will 
cough and beg and knock her head against some wall, as 
she did to-day, and the children will cry…. Then she will 
fall down, be taken to the police station and to the hospital, 
she will die, and the children …’
‘Oh, no…. God will not let it be!’ broke at last from So-
nia’s overburdened bosom.
She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her 
hands in dumb entreaty, as though it all depended upon 
him.
Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A 
 455minute passed. Sonia was standing with her hands and her 
head hanging in terrible dejection.
‘And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?’ he asked, 
stopping suddenly before her.
‘No,’ whispered Sonia.
‘Of course not. Have you tried?’ he added almost ironi-
cally.
‘Yes.’
‘And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.’
And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.
‘You don’t get money every day?’
Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed 
into her face again.
‘No,’ she whispered with a painful effort.
‘It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,’ he said sud-
denly.
‘No, no! It can’t be, no!’ Sonia cried aloud in desperation, 
as though she had been stabbed. ‘God would not allow any-
thing so awful!’
‘He lets others come to it.’
‘No, no! God will protect her, God!’ she repeated beside 
herself.
‘But, perhaps, there is no God at all,’ Raskolnikov an-
swered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at 
her.
Sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. 
She looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say 
something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter 
sobs, hiding her face in her hands.
 Crime and Punishment
456
‘You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your 
own mind is unhinged,’ he said after a brief silence.
Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the 
room in silence, not looking at her. At last he went up to her; 
his eyes glittered. He put his two hands on her shoulders 
and looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, 
feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. All at once he 
bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her 
foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And 
certainly he looked like a madman.
‘What are you doing to me?’ she muttered, turning pale, 
and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart.
He stood up at once.
‘I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suf-
fering of humanity,’ he said wildly and walked away to the 
window. ‘Listen,’ he added, turning to her a minute later. ‘I 
said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your 
little finger … and that I did my sister honour making her 
sit beside you.’
‘Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?’ cried 
Sonia, frightened. ‘Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m 
… dishonourable…. Ah, why did you say that?’
‘It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said 
that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are 
a great sinner, that’s true,’ he added almost solemnly, ‘and 
your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed your-
self for nothing. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t it fearful that you are 
living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time 
you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you 
 457are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from any-
thing? Tell me,’ he went on almost in a frenzy, ‘how this 
shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with 
other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be better, a thousand 
times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!’
‘But what would become of them?’ Sonia asked faintly, 
gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming sur-
prised at his suggestion.
Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her 
face; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps 
many times, and earnestly she had thought out in her de-
spair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely 
wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the 
cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and 
his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not 
noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw 
how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shame-
ful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. 
‘What, what,’ he thought, ‘could hitherto have hindered her 
from putting an end to it?’ Only then he realised what those 
poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Kat-
erina Ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her 
consumption, meant for Sonia.
But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her 
character and the amount of education she had after all re-
ceived, she could not in any case remain so. He was still 
confronted by the question, how could she have remained 
so long in that position without going out of her mind, 
since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? 
 Crime and Punishment
458
Of course he knew that Sonia’s position was an exception-
al case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, 
indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge of educa-
tion, her previous life might, one would have thought, have 
killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held 
her up—surely not depravity? All that infamy had obvi-
ously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real 
depravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that. He saw 
through her as she stood before him….
‘There are three ways before her,’ he thought, ‘the canal, 
the madhouse, or … at last to sink into depravity which ob-
scures the mind and turns the heart to stone.’
The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, 
he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could 
not help believing that the last end was the most likely.
‘But can that be true?’ he cried to himself. ‘Can that 
creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be 
consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity? 
Can the process already have begun? Can it be that she has 
only been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to 
be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot be!’ he cried, 
as Sonia had just before. ‘No, what has kept her from the ca-
nal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children…. And 
if she has not gone out of her mind … but who says she has 
not gone out of her mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, 
can one reason as she does? How can she sit on the edge of 
the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and 
refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she expect 
a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean mad-
 459ness?’
He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that ex-
planation indeed better than any other. He began looking 
more intently at her.
‘So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?’ he asked her.
Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an 
answer.
‘What should I be without God?’ she whispered rapidly, 
forcibly, glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and 
squeezing his hand.
‘Ah, so that is it!’ he thought.
‘And what does God do for you?’ he asked, probing her 
further.
Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not 
answer. Her weak chest kept heaving with emotion.
‘Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!’ she cried sud-
denly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him.
‘That’s it, that’s it,’ he repeated to himself.
‘He does everything,’ she whispered quickly, looking 
down again.
‘That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,’ he decided, 
scrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, 
almost morbid feeling. He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, 
angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash 
with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shak-
ing with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him 
more and more strange, almost impossible. ‘She is a reli-
gious maniac!’ he repeated to himself.
There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had 
 Crime and Punishment
460
noticed it every time he paced up and down the room. Now 
he took it up and looked at it. It was the New Testament 
in the Russian translation. It was bound in leather, old and 
worn.
‘Where did you get that?’ he called to her across the 
room.
She was still standing in the same place, three steps from 
the table.
‘It was brought me,’ she answered, as it were unwillingly, 
not looking at him.
‘Who brought it?’
‘Lizaveta, I asked her for it.’
‘Lizaveta! strange!’ he thought.
Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and 
more wonderful every moment. He carried the book to the 
candle and began to turn over the pages.
‘Where is the story of Lazarus?’ he asked suddenly.
Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not 
answer. She was standing sideways to the table.
‘Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.’
She stole a glance at him.
‘You are not looking in the right place…. It’s in the fourth 
gospel,’ she whispered sternly, without looking at him.
‘Find it and read it to me,’ he said. He sat down with his 
elbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and looked 
away sullenly, prepared to listen.
‘In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the mad-
house! I shall be there if I am not in a worse place,’ he 
muttered to himself.
 461Sonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and 
moved hesitatingly to the table. She took the book however.
‘Haven’t you read it?’ she asked, looking up at him across 
the table.
Her voice became sterner and sterner.
‘Long ago…. When I was at school. Read!’
‘And haven’t you heard it in church?’
‘I … haven’t been. Do you often go?’
‘N-no,’ whispered Sonia.
Raskolnikov smiled.
‘I understand…. And you won’t go to your father’s fu-
neral to-morrow?’
‘Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too … I had a re-
quiem service.’
‘For whom?’
‘For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.’
His nerves were more and more strained. His head be-
gan to go round.
‘Were you friends with Lizaveta?’
‘Yes…. She was good … she used to come … not often … 
she couldn’t…. We used to read together and … talk. She 
will see God.’
The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here 
was something new again: the mysterious meetings with 
Lizaveta and both of them— religious maniacs.
‘I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!’
‘Read!’ he cried irritably and insistently.
Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hard-
ly dared to read to him. He looked almost with exasperation 
 Crime and Punishment
462
at the ‘unhappy lunatic.’
‘What for? You don’t believe? …’ she whispered softly 
and as it were breathlessly.
‘Read! I want you to,’ he persisted. ‘You used to read to 
Lizaveta.’
Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands 
were shaking, her voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin 
and could not bring out the first syllable.
‘Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany 
…’ she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her 
voice broke like an overstrained string. There was a catch 
in her breath.
Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring 
herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more 
roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so. He un-
derstood only too well how painful it was for her to betray 
and unveil all that was her own. He understood that these 
feelings really were her secret treasure which she had kept 
perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived 
with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed 
by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly 
abuse and reproaches. But at the same time he knew now 
and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread 
and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to 
read to him that he might hear it, and to read now whatever 
might come of it! … He read this in her eyes, he could see it 
in her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the 
spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chap-
ter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse:
 463‘And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to com-
fort them concerning their brother.
‘Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming 
went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house.
‘Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been 
here, my brother had not died.
‘But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of 
God, God will give it Thee….’
Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that 
her voice would quiver and break again.
‘Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.
‘Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again 
in the resurrection, at the last day.
‘Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he 
that believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.
‘And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never 
die. Believest thou this?
‘She saith unto Him,’
(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and 
forcibly as though she were making a public confession of 
faith.)
‘Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of 
God Which should come into the world.’
She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but con-
trolling herself went on reading. Raskolnikov sat without 
moving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away. 
She read to the thirty-second verse.
‘Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw 
Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if 
 Crime and Punishment
464
Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
‘When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also 
weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and 
was troubled,
‘And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, 
Lord, come and see.
‘Jesus wept.
‘Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!
‘And some of them said, could not this Man which opened 
the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should 
not have died?’
Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. 
Yes, he had known it! She was trembling in a real physi-
cal fever. He had expected it. She was getting near the story 
of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph 
came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and 
joy gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she 
knew what she was reading by heart. At the last verse ‘Could 
not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind …’ drop-
ping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the 
reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who 
in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck 
by thunder, sobbing and believing…. ‘And he, he—too, is 
blinded and unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will be-
lieve, yes, yes! At once, now,’ was what she was dreaming, 
and she was quivering with happy anticipation.
‘Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the 
grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
‘Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of 
 465him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he 
stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.’
She laid emphasis on the word four.
‘Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou 
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
‘Then they took away the stone from the place where the 
dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, 
I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.
‘And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because 
of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe 
that Thou hast sent Me.
‘And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud 
voice, Lazarus, come forth.
‘And he that was dead came forth.’
(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as 
though she were seeing it before her eyes.)
‘Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was 
bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose 
him and let him go.
‘Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had 
seen the things which Jesus did believed on Him.’
She could read no more, closed the book and got up from 
her chair quickly.
‘That is all about the raising of Lazarus,’ she whispered 
severely and abruptly, and turning away she stood motion-
less, not daring to raise her eyes to him. She still trembled 
feverishly. The candle-end was flickering out in the battered 
candlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room 
the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been read-
 Crime and Punishment
466
ing together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.
‘I came to speak of something,’ Raskolnikov said aloud, 
frowning. He got up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes 
to him in silence. His face was particularly stern and there 
was a sort of savage determination in it.
‘I have abandoned my family to-day,’ he said, ‘my moth-
er and sister. I am not going to see them. I’ve broken with 
them completely.’
‘What for?’ asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with 
his mother and sister had left a great impression which she 
could not analyse. She heard his news almost with horror.
‘I have only you now,’ he added. ‘Let us go together…. I’ve 
come to you, we are both accursed, let us go our way to-
gether!’
His eyes glittered ‘as though he were mad,’ Sonia thought, 
in her turn.
‘Go where?’ she asked in alarm and she involuntarily 
stepped back.
‘How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know 
that and nothing more. It’s the same goal!’
She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew 
only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy.
‘No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but 
I have understood. I need you, that is why I have come to 
you.’
‘I don’t understand,’ whispered Sonia.
‘You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done the same? You, 
too, have transgressed … have had the strength to trans-
gress. You have laid hands on yourself, you have destroyed 
 467a life … your own (it’s all the same!). You might have lived 
in spirit and understanding, but you’ll end in the Hay Mar-
ket…. But you won’t be able to stand it, and if you remain 
alone you’ll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad 
creature already. So we must go together on the same road! 
Let us go!’
‘What for? What’s all this for?’ said Sonia, strangely and 
violently agitated by his words.
‘What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! 
You must look things straight in the face at last, and not 
weep like a child and cry that God won’t allow it. What will 
happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital to-mor-
row? She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon die and 
the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come 
to grief? Haven’t you seen children here at the street cor-
ners sent out by their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where 
those mothers live and in what surroundings. Children 
can’t remain children there! At seven the child is vicious 
and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of Christ: 
‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and 
love them, they are the humanity of the future….’
‘What’s to be done, what’s to be done?’ repeated Sonia, 
weeping hysterically and wringing her hands.
‘What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for 
all, that’s all, and take the suffering on oneself. What, you 
don’t understand? You’ll understand later…. Freedom and 
power, and above all, power! Over all trembling creation 
and all the ant-heap! … That’s the goal, remember that! 
That’s my farewell message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall 
 Crime and Punishment
468
speak to you. If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it 
all, and then remember these words. And some day later 
on, in years to come, you’ll understand perhaps what they 
meant. If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you who killed Liza-
veta…. Good-bye.’
Sonia started with terror.
‘Why, do you know who killed her?’ she asked, chilled 
with horror, looking wildly at him.
‘I know and will tell … you, only you. I have chosen you 
out. I’m not coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to 
tell you. I chose you out long ago to hear this, when your fa-
ther talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of 
it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands. To-morrow!’
He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But 
she herself was like one insane and felt it. Her head was go-
ing round.
‘Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? 
What did those words mean? It’s awful!’ But at the same 
time the idea did not enter her head, not for a moment! 
‘Oh, he must be terribly unhappy! … He has abandoned his 
mother and sister…. What for? What has happened? And 
what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had 
kissed her foot and said … said (yes, he had said it clearly) 
that he could not live without her…. Oh, merciful heavens!’
Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She 
jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, 
then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, 
Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and 
him … him with pale face, with burning eyes … kissing her 
 469feet, weeping.
On the other side of the door on the right, which divid-
ed Sonia’s room from Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room 
which had long stood empty. A card was fixed on the gate 
and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertis-
ing it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the room’s 
being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had 
been standing, listening at the door of the empty room. 
When Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a mo-
ment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the 
empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the 
door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck 
him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly en-
joyed it—so much so that he brought a chair that he might 
not in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure 
the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might lis-
ten in comfort.

## Chapter 5

W
hen next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskol-
nikov went into the department of the investigation 
of criminal causes and sent his name in to Porfiry Petro-
vitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was 
at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had ex-
pected that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in 
the waiting- room, and people, who apparently had nothing 
to do with him, were continually passing to and fro before 
him. In the next room which looked like an office, several 
clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no no-
tion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily 
and suspiciously about him to see whether there was not 
some guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him to 
prevent his escape. But there was nothing of the sort: he 
saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then 
other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him. 
He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew 
stronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that 
phantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they 
would not have let him stand and wait like that. And would 
they have waited till he elected to appear at eleven? Either 
the man had not yet given information, or … or simply he 
knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have 
seen anything?) and so all that had happened to him the 
 471day before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and 
overstrained imagination. This conjecture had begun to 
grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and 
despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh 
conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling—
and he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was 
trembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. 
What he dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he 
hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was 
afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was 
such that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go 
in with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to 
keep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at 
least to control his overstrained nerves. At that moment he 
was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.
He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His 
study was a room neither large nor small, furnished with 
a large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered 
in checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner 
and several chairs—all government furniture, of polished 
yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door, be-
yond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s 
entrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by 
which he had come in and they remained alone. He met his 
visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, 
and it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw 
signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had 
been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something 
very secret.
 Crime and Punishment
472
‘Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are … in our domain’ … 
began Porfiry, holding out both hands to him. ‘Come, sit 
down, old man … or perhaps you don’t like to be called ‘my 
dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’—/tout court? Please don’t think 
it too familiar…. Here, on the sofa.’
Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. 
‘In our domain,’ the apologies for familiarity, the French 
phrase tout court were all characteristic signs.
‘He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me 
one—he drew it back in time,’ struck him suspiciously. Both 
were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as 
lightning they looked away.
‘I brought you this paper … about the watch. Here it is. Is 
it all right or shall I copy it again?’
‘What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,’ 
Porfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had 
said it he took the paper and looked at it. ‘Yes, it’s all right. 
Nothing more is needed,’ he declared with the same rapid-
ity and he laid the paper on the table.
A minute later when he was talking of something else he 
took it from the table and put it on his bureau.
‘I believe you said yesterday you would like to question 
me … formally … about my acquaintance with the mur-
dered woman?’ Raskolnikov was beginning again. ‘Why 
did I put in ‘I believe’’ passed through his mind in a flash. 
‘Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘I believe’?’ came 
in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at 
the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first 
looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, 
 473and that this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were 
quivering, his emotion was increasing. ‘It’s bad, it’s bad! I 
shall say too much again.’
‘Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,’ muttered 
Porfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table with-
out any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the 
window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding 
Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again standing still 
and looking him straight in the face.
His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball 
rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back.
‘We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? 
Here, a cigarette!’ he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. 
‘You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters 
are through there, you know, my government quarters. But 
I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs 
done here. It’s almost finished now…. Government quar-
ters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?’
‘Yes, a capital thing,’ answered Raskolnikov, looking at 
him almost ironically.
‘A capital thing, a capital thing,’ repeated Porfiry Petro-
vitch, as though he had just thought of something quite 
different. ‘Yes, a capital thing,’ he almost shouted at last, 
suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and stopping short two 
steps from him.
This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its inepti-
tude with the serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he 
turned upon his visitor.
But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and 
 Crime and Punishment
474
he could not resist an ironical and rather incautious chal-
lenge.
‘Tell me, please,’ he asked suddenly, looking almost in-
solently at him and taking a kind of pleasure in his own 
insolence. ‘I believe it’s a sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tra-
dition—for all investigating lawyers—to begin their attack 
from afar, with a trivial, or at least an irrelevant subject, so 
as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man they are cross-
examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to 
give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal 
question. Isn’t that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I 
fancy, in all the manuals of the art?’
‘Yes, yes…. Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke 
about government quarters … eh?’
And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his 
eyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed 
over his face. The wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed 
out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he sud-
denly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all 
over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter 
forced himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that 
he was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he turned 
almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s repulsion overcame all pre-
caution; he left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred 
at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intention-
ally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution 
on both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be 
laughing in his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed 
at the annoyance with which the visitor received it. The lat-
 475ter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw 
that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just be-
fore either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into 
a trap; that there must be something, some motive here un-
known to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness 
and in another moment would break upon him …
He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat 
and took his cap.
‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began resolutely, though with 
considerable irritation, ‘yesterday you expressed a desire 
that I should come to you for some inquiries’ (he laid spe-
cial stress on the word ‘inquiries’). ‘I have come and if you 
have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to with-
draw. I have no time to spare…. I have to be at the funeral 
of that man who was run over, of whom you … know also,’ 
he added, feeling angry at once at having made this addi-
tion and more irritated at his anger. ‘I am sick of it all, do 
you hear? and have long been. It’s partly what made me ill. 
In short,’ he shouted, feeling that the phrase about his ill-
ness was still more out of place, ‘in short, kindly examine 
me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so 
in the proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, 
and so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing 
to keep us now.’
‘Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I ques-
tion you about?’ cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change 
of tone, instantly leaving off laughing. ‘Please don’t disturb 
yourself,’ he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily 
making Raskolnikov sit down. ‘There’s no hurry, there’s no 
 Crime and Punishment
476
hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come 
to see me at last … I look upon you simply as a visitor. And 
as for my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion 
Romanovitch. Rodion Romanovitch? That is your name? 
… It’s my nerves, you tickled me so with your witty obser-
vation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with laughter like 
an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time…. I’m often 
afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I 
shall think you are angry …’
Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, 
still frowning angrily. He did sit down, but still held his 
cap.
‘I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion 
Romanovitch,’ Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about 
the room and again avoiding his visitor’s eyes. ‘You see, I’m 
a bachelor, a man of no consequence and not used to soci-
ety; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m running 
to seed and … and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, 
that in our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who 
are not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it 
takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for 
conversation—they are dumb, they sit opposite each oth-
er and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of conversation, 
ladies for instance … people in high society always have 
their subjects of conversation, c’est de rigueur but people of 
the middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always 
tongue-tied and awkward. What is the reason of it? Wheth-
er it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so 
honest we don’t want to deceive one another, I don’t know. 
 477What do you think? Do put down your cap, it looks as if 
you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable … I am so 
delighted …’
Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening 
in silence with a serious frowning face to the vague and 
empty chatter of Porfiry Petrovitch. ‘Does he really want to 
distract my attention with his silly babble?’
‘I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five min-
utes with a friend?’ Porfiry pattered on, ‘and you know all 
these official duties … please don’t mind my running up 
and down, excuse it, my dear fellow, I am very much afraid 
of offending you, but exercise is absolutely indispensable for 
me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be moving about for 
five minutes … I suffer from my sedentary life … I always 
intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all 
ranks, even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily 
there; there you have it, modern science … yes, yes…. But 
as for my duties here, inquiries and all such formalities … 
you mentioned inquiries yourself just now … I assure you 
these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for 
the interrogator than for the interrogated…. You made the 
observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily.’ (Ras-
kolnikov had made no observation of the kind.) ‘One gets 
into a muddle! A regular muddle! One keeps harping on 
the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and we 
shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And 
as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thor-
oughly agree with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the 
rudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him 
 Crime and Punishment
478
with irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then 
deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!—your felicitous 
comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by 
‘government quarters’ … he-he! You are an ironical person. 
Come. I won’t go on! Ah, by the way, yes! One word leads 
to another. You spoke of formality just now, apropos of the 
inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality? In many 
cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and 
gets a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on 
formality, allow me to assure you. And after all, what does 
it amount to? An examining lawyer cannot be bounded by 
formality at every step. The work of investigation is, so to 
speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!’
Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had sim-
ply babbled on uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few 
enigmatic words and again reverting to incoherence. He 
was almost running about the room, moving his fat little 
legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his 
right hand behind his back, while with his left making ges-
ticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his 
words. Raskolnikov suddenly noticed that as he ran about 
the room he seemed twice to stop for a moment near the 
door, as though he were listening.
‘Is he expecting anything?’
‘You are certainly quite right about it,’ Porfiry began 
gaily, looking with extraordinary simplicity at Raskol-
nikov (which startled him and instantly put him on his 
guard); ‘certainly quite right in laughing so wittily at our 
legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological 
 479methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if 
one adheres too closely to the forms. Yes … I am talking of 
forms again. Well, if I recognise, or more strictly speaking, 
if I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case 
entrusted to me … you’re reading for the law, of course, Ro-
dion Romanovitch?’
‘Yes, I was …’
‘Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future—though 
don’t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the ar-
ticles you publish about crime! No, I simply make bold to 
state it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, 
why, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even though I 
had evidence against him? In one case I may be bound, for 
instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in 
quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let 
him walk about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t 
quite understand, so I’ll give you a clearer example. If I put 
him in prison too soon, I may very likely give him, so to 
speak, moral support, he-he! You’re laughing?’
Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with 
compressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petro-
vitch’s.
‘Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men 
are so different. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evi-
dence. But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two 
ways. I am an examining lawyer and a weak man, I confess 
it. I should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematical-
ly clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence such as 
twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof! 
 Crime and Punishment
480
And if I shut him up too soon—even though I might be con-
vinced he was the man, I should very likely be depriving 
myself of the means of getting further evidence against him. 
And how? By giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I 
shall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so 
that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at Sevastopol, 
soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright 
that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at 
once. But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular 
siege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the 
thing would drag on for two months at least. You’re laugh-
ing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re right, too. 
You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I admit. 
But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, 
the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules 
are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down 
in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, 
every crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at 
once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a 
case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that 
sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I 
don’t touch him and don’t worry him, but let him know or 
at least suspect every moment that I know all about it and 
am watching him day and night, and if he is in continual 
suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his head. He’ll 
come of himself, or maybe do something which will make 
it as plain as twice two are four—it’s delightful. It may be 
so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intel-
ligent man cultivated on a certain side, it’s a dead certainty. 
 481For, my dear fellow, it’s a very important matter to know on 
what side a man is cultivated. And then there are nerves, 
there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they are 
all sick, nervous and irritable! … And then how they all 
suffer from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine 
for us. And it’s no anxiety to me, his running about the 
town free! Let him, let him walk about for a bit! I know well 
enough that I’ve caught him and that he won’t escape me. 
Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole 
will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching 
and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of 
the country perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real 
rude Russian peasants. A modern cultivated man would 
prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants. 
He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on the surface. It’s not 
merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is psychologically 
unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression! Through 
a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go. 
Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will 
keep circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its 
attractions. He’ll begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round 
himself, he’ll worry himself to death! What’s more he will 
provide me with a mathematical proof—if I only give him 
long enough interval…. And he’ll keep circling round me, 
getting nearer and nearer and then—flop! He’ll fly straight 
into my mouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very 
amusing, he-he-he! You don’t believe me?’
Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, 
still gazing with the same intensity into Porfiry’s face.
 Crime and Punishment
482
‘It’s a lesson,’ he thought, turning cold. ‘This is beyond 
the cat playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He can’t be 
showing off his power with no motive … prompting me; 
he is far too clever for that … he must have another object. 
What is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are pretending, 
to scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no 
real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, 
to work me up beforehand and so to crush me. But you are 
wrong, you won’t do it! But why give me such a hint? Is he 
reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my friend, you are 
wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap for 
me … let us see what you have in store for me.’
And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown or-
deal. At times he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. 
This anger was what he dreaded from the beginning. He felt 
that his parched lips were flecked with foam, his heart was 
throbbing. But he was still determined not to speak till the 
right moment. He realised that this was the best policy in 
his position, because instead of saying too much he would 
be irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him 
into speaking too freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped 
for.
‘No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing 
a harmless joke on you,’ Porfiry began again, getting more 
and more lively, chuckling at every instant and again pac-
ing round the room. ‘And to be sure you’re right: God has 
given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in 
other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, 
excuse an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a 
 483man still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put 
intellect above everything, like all young people. Playful wit 
and abstract arguments fascinate you and that’s for all the 
world like the old Austrian Hof-kriegsrath as far as I can 
judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten 
Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study 
they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, 
General Mack surrendered with all his army, he-he-he! I 
see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are laughing at a civil-
ian like me, taking examples out of military history! But I 
can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science. 
And I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve 
certainly missed my proper career. I ought to have been in 
the army, upon my word I ought. I shouldn’t have been a 
Napoleon, but I might have been a major, he-he! Well, I’ll 
tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about this special 
case I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my dear 
sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they some-
times deceive the sharpest calculation! I—listen to an old 
man—am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch’ (as 
he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-
thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice 
changed and he seemed to shrink together) ‘Moreover, I’m a 
candid man … am I a candid man or not? What do you say? 
I fancy I really am: I tell you these things for nothing and 
don’t even expect a reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit 
in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adorn-
ment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it 
can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining 
 Crime and Punishment
484
lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable to 
be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a 
man after all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s 
temperament, worse luck for him! But young people carried 
away by their own wit don’t think of that ‘when they over-
step all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly expressed it 
yesterday. He will lie—that is, the man who is a special case 
the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; 
you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of 
his wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant mo-
ment he will faint. Of course there may be illness and a 
stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s given us the 
idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his tem-
perament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be 
carried away by his playful wit into making fun of the man 
who suspects him, he will turn pale as it were on purpose to 
mislead, but his paleness will be too natural too much like 
the real thing, again he has given us an idea! Though his 
questioner may be deceived at first, he will think differently 
next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like that at 
every step! He puts himself forward where he is not want-
ed, speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings 
in all sorts of allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks 
why didn’t you take me long ago? he-he-he! And that can 
happen, you know, with the cleverest man, the psychologist, 
the literary man. The temperament reflects everything like 
a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are 
you so pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall 
I open the window?’
 485‘Oh, don’t trouble, please,’ cried Raskolnikov and he sud-
denly broke into a laugh. ‘Please don’t trouble.’
Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly 
he too laughed. Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly 
checking his hysterical laughter.
‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began, speaking loudly and dis-
tinctly, though his legs trembled and he could scarcely 
stand. ‘I see clearly at last that you actually suspect me of 
murdering that old woman and her sister Lizaveta. Let me 
tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you find that 
you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then 
prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered 
at to my face and worried …’
His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could 
not restrain his voice.
‘I won’t allow it!’ he shouted, bringing his fist down on 
the table. ‘Do you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t al-
low it.’
‘Good heavens! What does it mean?’ cried Porfiry Petro-
vitch, apparently quite frightened. ‘Rodion Romanovitch, 
my dear fellow, what is the matter with you?’
‘I won’t allow it,’ Raskolnikov shouted again.
‘Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, 
what could we say to them?’ Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in 
horror, bringing his face close to Raskolnikov’s.
‘I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,’ Raskolnikov repeated 
mechanically, but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.
Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.
‘Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear 
 Crime and Punishment
486
fellow. You’re ill!’ and he was running to the door to call 
for some when he found a decanter of water in the corner. 
‘Come, drink a little,’ he whispered, rushing up to him with 
the decanter. ‘It will be sure to do you good.’
Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural 
that Raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with 
wild curiosity. He did not take the water, however.
‘Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive your-
self out of your mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some 
water, do drink a little.’
He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it 
mechanically to his lips, but set it on the table again with 
disgust.
‘Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your ill-
ness again, my dear fellow,’ Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with 
friendly sympathy, though he still looked rather discon-
certed. ‘Good heavens, you must take more care of yourself! 
Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday—I 
know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they 
made of it! … Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d 
been. We dined and he talked and talked away, and I could 
only throw up my hands in despair! Did he come from you? 
But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit down!’
‘No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he 
went,’ Raskolnikov answered sharply.
‘You knew?’
‘I knew. What of it?’
‘Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than 
that about you; I know about everything. I know how you 
 487went to take a flat at night when it was dark and how you 
rang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the work-
men and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, 
I understand your state of mind at that time … but you’ll 
drive yourself mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your 
head! You’re full of generous indignation at the wrongs 
you’ve received, first from destiny, and then from the police 
officers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force 
them to speak out and make an end of it all, because you 
are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t 
it? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way 
you’ll lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too good 
a man for such a position, you must know that. You are ill 
and he is good and your illness is infectious for him … I’ll 
tell you about it when you are more yourself…. But do sit 
down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you look shocking, do 
sit down.’
Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was 
hot all over. In amazement he listened with strained atten-
tion to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he 
looked after him with friendly solicitude. But he did not be-
lieve a word he said, though he felt a strange inclination to 
believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had ut-
terly overwhelmed him. ‘How can it be, he knows about the 
flat then,’ he thought suddenly, ‘and he tells it me himself!’
‘Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exact-
ly similar, a case of morbid psychology,’ Porfiry went on 
quickly. ‘A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up! 
It was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he 
 Crime and Punishment
488
imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but 
only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when 
he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, 
he sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his 
brain, he began imagining things and he persuaded him-
self that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court of 
Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and 
put under proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-
tut-tut! Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into 
delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, 
to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I’ve 
studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man 
is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a 
belfry. Just the same with bell-ringing…. It’s all illness, Ro-
dion Romanovitch! You have begun to neglect your illness. 
You should consult an experienced doctor, what’s the good 
of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You were delirious 
when you did all this!’
For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.
‘Is it possible, is it possible,’ flashed through his mind, 
‘that he is still lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.’ He rejected 
that idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him, 
feeling that that fury might drive him mad.
‘I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,’ he cried, 
straining every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, ‘I was 
quite myself, do you hear?’
‘Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you 
were not delirious, you were particularly emphatic about 
it! I understand all you can tell me! A-ach! … Listen, Ro-
 489dion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were actually 
a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable 
business, would you insist that you were not delirious but in 
full possession of your faculties? And so emphatically and 
persistently? Would it be possible? Quite impossible, to my 
thinking. If you had anything on your conscience, you cer-
tainly ought to insist that you were delirious. That’s so, isn’t 
it?’
There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov 
drew back on the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared 
in silent perplexity at him.
‘Another thing about Razumihin—you certainly ought 
to have said that he came of his own accord, to have con-
cealed your part in it! But you don’t conceal it! You lay stress 
on his coming at your instigation.’
Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his 
back.
‘You keep telling lies,’ he said slowly and weakly, twisting 
his lips into a sickly smile, ‘you are trying again to show that 
you know all my game, that you know all I shall say before-
hand,’ he said, conscious himself that he was not weighing 
his words as he ought. ‘You want to frighten me … or you 
are simply laughing at me …’
He still stared at him as he said this and again there was 
a light of intense hatred in his eyes.
‘You keep lying,’ he said. ‘You know perfectly well that 
the best policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly 
as possible … to conceal as little as possible. I don’t believe 
you!’
 Crime and Punishment
490
‘What a wily person you are!’ Porfiry tittered, ‘there’s no 
catching you; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t be-
lieve me? But still you do believe me, you believe a quarter; 
I’ll soon make you believe the whole, because I have a sin-
cere liking for you and genuinely wish you good.’
Raskolnikov’s lips trembled.
‘Yes, I do,’ went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm 
genially, ‘you must take care of your illness. Besides, your 
mother and sister are here now; you must think of them. 
You must soothe and comfort them and you do nothing but 
frighten them …’
‘What has that to do with you? How do you know it? 
What concern is it of yours? You are keeping watch on me 
and want to let me know it?’
‘Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! 
You don’t notice that in your excitement you tell me and 
others everything. From Razumihin, too, I learnt a num-
ber of interesting details yesterday. No, you interrupted me, 
but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspicious-
ness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To 
return to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, 
have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a 
fact worth having), and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had 
the slightest suspicion of you, should I have acted like that? 
No, I should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let 
you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your atten-
tion and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your 
expression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at 
ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why 
 491did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood? And 
why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police 
station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how I ought to have acted 
if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to have taken 
your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and per-
haps have arrested you, too … so I have no suspicion of you, 
since I have not done that! But you can’t look at it normally 
and you see nothing, I say again.’
Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not 
fail to perceive it.
‘You are lying all the while,’ he cried, ‘I don’t know your 
object, but you are lying. You did not speak like that just 
now and I cannot be mistaken!’
‘I am lying?’ Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but 
preserving a good-humoured and ironical face, as though 
he were not in the least concerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion 
of him. ‘I am lying … but how did I treat you just now, I, 
the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving you ev-
ery means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury, 
melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! 
He-he-he! Though, indeed, all those psychological means of 
defence are not very reliable and cut both ways: illness, de-
lirium, I don’t remember—that’s all right, but why, my good 
sir, in your illness and in your delirium were you haunted 
by just those delusions and not by any others? There may 
have been others, eh? He-he-he!’
Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at 
him.
‘Briefly,’ he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet 
 Crime and Punishment
492
and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, ‘briefly, I want 
to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspi-
cion or not? Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once for all 
and make haste!’
‘What a business I’m having with you!’ cried Porfiry with 
a perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face. ‘And 
why do you want to know, why do you want to know so 
much, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why, you are 
like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? 
Why do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!’
‘I repeat,’ Raskolnikov cried furiously, ‘that I can’t put up 
with it!’
‘With what? Uncertainty?’ interrupted Porfiry.
‘Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have 
it. I can’t and I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?’ he shouted, 
bringing his fist down on the table again.
‘Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take 
care of yourself. I am not joking,’ Porfiry whispered, but 
this time there was not the look of old womanish good na-
ture and alarm in his face. Now he was peremptory, stern, 
frowning and for once laying aside all mystification.
But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewil-
dered, suddenly fell into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, 
he again obeyed the command to speak quietly, though he 
was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.
‘I will not allow myself to be tortured,’ he whispered, 
instantly recognising with hatred that he could not help 
obeying the command and driven to even greater fury by 
the thought. ‘Arrest me, search me, but kindly act in due 
 493form and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!’
‘Don’t worry about the form,’ Porfiry interrupted with 
the same sly smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over 
Raskolnikov. ‘I invited you to see me quite in a friendly 
way.’
‘I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you 
hear? And, here, I take my cap and go. What will you say 
now if you mean to arrest me?’
He took up his cap and went to the door.
‘And won’t you see my little surprise?’ chuckled Porfiry, 
again taking him by the arm and stopping him at the door.
He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured 
which maddened Raskolnikov.
‘What surprise?’ he asked, standing still and looking at 
Porfiry in alarm.
‘My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-
he-he!’ (He pointed to the locked door.) ‘I locked him in 
that he should not escape.’
‘What is it? Where? What? …’
Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened 
it, but it was locked.
‘It’s locked, here is the key!’
And he brought a key out of his pocket.
‘You are lying,’ roared Raskolnikov without restraint, 
‘you lie, you damned punchinello!’ and he rushed at Porfiry 
who retreated to the other door, not at all alarmed.
‘I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I 
may betray myself to you …’
‘Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear 
 Crime and Punishment
494
Rodion Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I 
shall call the clerks.’
‘You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and 
tried to work me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, 
that was your object! Produce your facts! I understand it all. 
You’ve no evidence, you have only wretched rubbishly sus-
picions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you wanted 
to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests 
and deputies…. Are you waiting for them? eh! What are 
you waiting for? Where are they? Produce them?’
‘Why deputies, my good man? What things people will 
imagine! And to do so would not be acting in form as you 
say, you don’t know the business, my dear fellow…. And 
there’s no escaping form, as you see,’ Porfiry muttered, lis-
tening at the door through which a noise could be heard.
‘Ah, they’re coming,’ cried Raskolnikov. ‘You’ve sent for 
them! You expected them! Well, produce them all: your 
deputies, your witnesses, what you like! … I am ready!’
But at this moment a strange incident occurred, some-
thing so unexpected that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry 
Petrovitch could have looked for such a conclusion to their 
interview.

## Chapter 6

W
hen he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how 
Raskolnikov saw it.
The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the 
door was opened a little.
‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. ‘Why, I 
gave orders …’
For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident 
that there were several persons at the door, and that they 
were apparently pushing somebody back.
‘What is it?’ Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.
‘The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,’ someone an-
swered.
‘He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s 
he doing here? How irregular!’ cried Porfiry, rushing to the 
door.
‘But he …’ began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.
Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, 
then someone gave a violent shove, and then a man, very 
pale, strode into the room.
This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He 
stared straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There 
was a determined gleam in his eyes; at the same time there 
was a deathly pallor in his face, as though he were being led 
to the scaffold. His white lips were faintly twitching.
 Crime and Punishment
496
He was dressed like a workman and was of medium 
height, very young, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with 
thin spare features. The man whom he had thrust back fol-
lowed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by 
the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm 
away.
Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. 
Some of them tried to get in. All this took place almost in-
stantaneously.
‘Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for! … Why 
have you brought him so soon?’ Porfiry Petrovitch mut-
tered, extremely annoyed, and as it were thrown out of his 
reckoning.
But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.
‘What’s the matter?’ cried Porfiry, surprised.
‘I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,’ Nikolay 
articulated suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly 
loudly.
For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been 
struck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically 
retreated to the door, and stood immovable.
‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his 
momentary stupefaction.
‘I … am the murderer,’ repeated Nikolay, after a brief 
pause.
‘What … you … what … whom did you kill?’ Porfiry 
Petrovitch was obviously bewildered.
Nikolay again was silent for a moment.
‘Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I … 
 497killed … with an axe. Darkness came over me,’ he added 
suddenly, and was again silent.
He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood 
for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly 
roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. 
They instantly vanished and closed the door. Then he looked 
towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, star-
ing wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped 
short, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again 
at Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted 
at the latter.
‘You’re in too great a hurry,’ he shouted at him, almost 
angrily. ‘I didn’t ask you what came over you…. Speak, did 
you kill them?’
‘I am the murderer…. I want to give evidence,’ Nikolay 
pronounced.
‘Ach! What did you kill them with?’
‘An axe. I had it ready.’
‘Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?’
Nikolay did not understand the question.
‘Did you do it alone?’
‘Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in 
it.’
‘Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you 
ran downstairs like that at the time? The porters met you 
both!’
‘It was to put them off the scent … I ran after Mitka,’ 
Nikolay replied hurriedly, as though he had prepared the 
answer.
 Crime and Punishment
498
‘I knew it!’ cried Porfiry, with vexation. ‘It’s not his own 
tale he is telling,’ he muttered as though to himself, and 
suddenly his eyes rested on Raskolnikov again.
He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a 
moment he had forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken 
aback.
‘My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!’ he flew up to 
him, ‘this won’t do; I’m afraid you must go … it’s no good 
your staying … I will … you see, what a surprise! … Good-
bye!’
And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.
‘I suppose you didn’t expect it?’ said Raskolnikov who, 
though he had not yet fully grasped the situation, had re-
gained his courage.
‘You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your 
hand is trembling! He-he!’
‘You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!’
‘Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.’
They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for 
Raskolnikov to be gone.
‘And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to 
me?’ Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.
‘Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are 
an ironical person! Come, till we meet!’
‘I believe we can say good-bye!’
‘That’s in God’s hands,’ muttered Porfiry, with an unnat-
ural smile.
As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed 
that many people were looking at him. Among them he saw 
 499the two porters from the house, whom he had invited that 
night to the police station. They stood there waiting. But 
he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of 
Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the 
latter running after him, out of breath.
‘One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in 
God’s hands, but as a matter of form there are some ques-
tions I shall have to ask you … so we shall meet again, shan’t 
we?’
And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.
‘Shan’t we?’ he added again.
He seemed to want to say something more, but could not 
speak out.
‘You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has 
just passed … I lost my temper,’ began Raskolnikov, who 
had so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly in-
clined to display his coolness.
‘Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,’ Porfiry replied, al-
most gleefully. ‘I myself, too … I have a wicked temper, I 
admit it! But we shall meet again. If it’s God’s will, we may 
see a great deal of one another.’
‘And will get to know each other through and through?’ 
added Raskolnikov.
‘Yes; know each other through and through,’ assented 
Porfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking 
earnestly at Raskolnikov. ‘Now you’re going to a birthday 
party?’
‘To a funeral.’
‘Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get 
 Crime and Punishment
500
well.’
‘I don’t know what to wish you,’ said Raskolnikov, who 
had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again. ‘I 
should like to wish you success, but your office is such a 
comical one.’
‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but 
he seemed to prick up his ears at this.
‘Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing 
that poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he 
confessed! You must have been at him day and night, prov-
ing to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has 
confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are ly-
ing,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s 
not your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a 
comical business!’
‘He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just 
now that it was not his own tale he was telling?’
‘How could I help noticing it!’
‘He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! 
You’ve really a playful mind! And you always fasten on the 
comic side … he-he! They say that was the marked charac-
teristic of Gogol, among the writers.’
‘Yes, of Gogol.’
‘Yes, of Gogol…. I shall look forward to meeting you.’
‘So shall I.’
Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled 
and bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of 
an hour on the sofa, trying to collect his thoughts. He did 
not attempt to think about Nikolay; he was stupefied; he 
 501felt that his confession was something inexplicable, amaz-
ing—something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s 
confession was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact 
were clear to him at once, its falsehood could not fail to be 
discovered, and then they would be after him again. Till 
then, at least, he was free and must do something for him-
self, for the danger was imminent.
But how imminent? His position gradually became clear 
to him. Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his 
recent scene with Porfiry, he could not help shuddering 
again with horror. Of course, he did not yet know all Por-
firy’s aims, he could not see into all his calculations. But he 
had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew bet-
ter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s ‘lead’ had been 
for him. A little more and he might have given himself away 
completely, circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temper-
ament and from the first glance seeing through him, Porfiry, 
though playing a bold game, was bound to win. There’s 
no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself 
seriously, but no facts had come to light as yet; there was 
nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the po-
sition? Wasn’t he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying 
to get at? Had he really some surprise prepared for him? 
And what was it? Had he really been expecting something 
or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for 
the unexpected appearance of Nikolay?
Porfiry had shown almost all his cards—of course, he 
had risked something in showing them—and if he had re-
ally had anything up his sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he 
 Crime and Punishment
502
would have shown that, too. What was that ‘surprise’? Was 
it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have concealed 
anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His yes-
terday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he 
to-day? If Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be con-
nected with him….
He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his 
face hidden in his hands. He was still shivering nervously. 
At last he got up, took his cap, thought a minute, and went 
to the door.
He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, 
he might consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden 
sense almost of joy; he wanted to make haste to Katerina 
Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for the funeral, of course, 
but he would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there 
at once he would see Sonia.
He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile 
came for a moment on to his lips.
‘To-day! To-day,’ he repeated to himself. ‘Yes, to-day! So 
it must be….’
But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of 
itself. He started and moved back. The door opened gently 
and slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure—yester-
day’s visitor from underground.
The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov 
without speaking, and took a step forward into the room. 
He was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the 
same dress, but there was a great change in his face; he 
looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put his 
 503hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he 
would have looked exactly like a peasant woman.
‘What do you want?’ asked Raskolnikov, numb with ter-
ror. The man was still silent, but suddenly he bowed down 
almost to the ground, touching it with his finger.
‘What is it?’ cried Raskolnikov.
‘I have sinned,’ the man articulated softly.
‘How?’
‘By evil thoughts.’
They looked at one another.
‘I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and 
bade the porters go to the police station and asked about 
the blood, I was vexed that they let you go and took you for 
drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my sleep. And remem-
bering the address we came here yesterday and asked for 
you….’
‘Who came?’ Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly begin-
ning to recollect.
‘I did, I’ve wronged you.’
‘Then you come from that house?’
‘I was standing at the gate with them … don’t you re-
member? We have carried on our trade in that house for 
years past. We cure and prepare hides, we take work home 
… most of all I was vexed….’
And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the 
gateway came clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recol-
lected that there had been several people there besides the 
porters, women among them. He remembered one voice 
had suggested taking him straight to the police- station. He 
 Crime and Punishment
504
could not recall the face of the speaker, and even now he 
did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned 
round and made him some answer….
So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most 
awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost, 
had almost done for himself on account of such a trivial cir-
cumstance. So this man could tell nothing except his asking 
about the flat and the blood stains. So Porfiry, too, had noth-
ing but that delirium no facts but this psychology which cuts 
both ways nothing positive. So if no more facts come to light 
(and they must not, they must not!) then … then what can 
they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they ar-
rest him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the 
flat and had not known about it before.
‘Was it you who told Porfiry … that I’d been there?’ he 
cried, struck by a sudden idea.
‘What Porfiry?’
‘The head of the detective department?’
‘Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.’
‘To-day?’
‘I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard 
it all, how he worried you.’
‘Where? What? When?’
‘Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.’
‘What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could 
it happen? Upon my word!’
‘I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,’ be-
gan the man; ‘for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be 
angry that we did not come at the time. I was vexed and I 
 505lost my sleep, and I began making inquiries. And finding 
out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The first time I 
went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t 
see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I 
informed him of everything, just as it happened, and he be-
gan skipping about the room and punching himself on the 
chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it? If I’d known 
about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out, called 
somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he 
turned to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me 
a great deal; and I told him everything, and I told him that 
you didn’t dare to say a word in answer to me yesterday and 
that you didn’t recognise me. And he fell to running about 
again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and getting an-
gry and running about, and when you were announced he 
told me to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. 
‘Don’t move, whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair 
there for me and locked me in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call 
you.’ And when Nikolay’d been brought he let me out as 
soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you again and ques-
tion you,’ he said.’
‘And did he question Nikolay while you were there?’
‘He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to 
Nikolay.’
The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, 
touching the ground with his finger.
‘Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.’
‘May God forgive you,’ answered Raskolnikov.
And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not 
 Crime and Punishment
506
to the ground, turned slowly and went out of the room.
‘It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,’ repeated 
Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.
‘Now we’ll make a fight for it,’ he said, with a malicious 
smile, as he went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at 
himself; with shame and contempt he recollected his ‘cow-
ardice.’
