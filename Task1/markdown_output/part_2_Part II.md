## Chapter 1

S
o he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to 
wake up, and at such moments he noticed that it was far 
into the night, but it did not occur to him to get up. At last 
he noticed that it was beginning to get light. He was lying 
on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion. Fearful, 
despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which 
he heard every night, indeed, under his window after two 
o’clock. They woke him up now.
‘Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,’ he 
thought, ‘it’s past two o’clock,’ and at once he leaped up, as 
though someone had pulled him from the sofa.
‘What! Past two o’clock!’
He sat down on the sofa—and instantly recollected 
everything! All at once, in one flash, he recollected every-
thing.
For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A 
dreadful chill came over him; but the chill was from the 
fever that had begun long before in his sleep. Now he was 
suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his teeth chat-
tered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door 
and began listening—everything in the house was asleep. 
With amazement he gazed at himself and everything in the 
room around him, wondering how he could have come in 
the night before without fastening the door, and have flung 
 Crime and Punishment
134
himself on the sofa without undressing, without even tak-
ing his hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor 
near his pillow.
‘If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? 
That I’m drunk but …’
He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and 
he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head to 
foot, all his clothes; were there no traces? But there was no 
doing it like that; shivering with cold, he began taking off 
everything and looking over again. He turned everything 
over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, 
went through his search three times.
But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one 
place, where some thick drops of congealed blood were 
clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers. He picked up a 
big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads. There seemed 
to be nothing more.
Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things 
he had taken out of the old woman’s box were still in his 
pockets! He had not thought till then of taking them out 
and hiding them! He had not even thought of them while he 
was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed 
to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had 
pulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to 
be sure there was nothing left, he carried the whole heap to 
the corner. The paper had come off the bottom of the wall 
and hung there in tatters. He began stuffing all the things 
into the hole under the paper: ‘They’re in! All out of sight, 
and the purse too!’ he thought gleefully, getting up and gaz-
 135ing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. 
Suddenly he shuddered all over with horror; ‘My God!’ he 
whispered in despair: ‘what’s the matter with me? Is that 
hidden? Is that the way to hide things?’
He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had 
only thought of money, and so had not prepared a hiding-
place.
‘But now, now, what am I glad of?’ he thought, ‘Is that 
hiding things? My reason’s deserting me—simply!’
He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once 
shaken by another unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanical-
ly he drew from a chair beside him his old student’s winter 
coat, which was still warm though almost in rags, covered 
himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and 
delirium. He lost consciousness.
Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped 
up a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his 
clothes again.
‘How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, 
yes; I have not taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, for-
got a thing like that! Such a piece of evidence!’
He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and 
threw the bits among his linen under the pillow.
‘Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever 
happened; I think not, I think not, any way!’ he repeated, 
standing in the middle of the room, and with painful con-
centration he fell to gazing about him again, at the floor and 
everywhere, trying to make sure he had not forgotten any-
thing. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory, 
 Crime and Punishment
136
and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began 
to be an insufferable torture.
‘Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my pun-
ishment coming upon me? It is!’
The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually 
lying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone 
coming in would see them!
‘What is the matter with me!’ he cried again, like one dis-
traught.
Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all 
his clothes were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there 
were a great many stains, but that he did not see them, did 
not notice them because his perceptions were failing, were 
going to pieces … his reason was clouded…. Suddenly he 
remembered that there had been blood on the purse too. 
‘Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put 
the wet purse in my pocket!’
In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!—
there were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!
‘So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have 
some sense and memory, since I guessed it of myself,’ he 
thought triumphantly, with a deep sigh of relief; ‘it’s simply 
the weakness of fever, a moment’s delirium,’ and he tore the 
whole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers. At that 
instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the sock which 
poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He 
flung off his boots; ‘traces indeed! The tip of the sock was 
soaked with blood;’ he must have unwarily stepped into 
that pool…. ‘But what am I to do with this now? Where am 
 137I to put the sock and rags and pocket?’
He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the 
middle of the room.
‘In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of 
all. Burn them? But what can I burn them with? There are 
no matches even. No, better go out and throw it all away 
somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,’ he repeated, sitting 
down on the sofa again, ‘and at once, this minute, without 
lingering …’
But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the un-
bearable icy shivering came over him; again he drew his 
coat over him.
And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by 
the impulse to ‘go off somewhere at once, this moment, and 
fling it all away, so that it may be out of sight and done with, 
at once, at once!’ Several times he tried to rise from the sofa, 
but could not.
He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knock-
ing at his door.
‘Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!’ 
shouted Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. ‘For 
whole days together he’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is 
too. Open I tell you. It’s past ten.’
‘Maybe he’s not at home,’ said a man’s voice.
‘Ha! that’s the porter’s voice…. What does he want?’
He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his 
heart was a positive pain.
‘Then who can have latched the door?’ retorted Nastasya. 
‘He’s taken to bolting himself in! As if he were worth steal-
 Crime and Punishment
138
ing! Open, you stupid, wake up!’
‘What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. 
Resist or open? Come what may! …’
He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.
His room was so small that he could undo the latch 
without leaving the bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were 
standing there.
Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with 
a defiant and desperate air at the porter, who without a word 
held out a grey folded paper sealed with bottle-wax.
‘A notice from the office,’ he announced, as he gave him 
the paper.
‘From what office?’
‘A summons to the police office, of course. You know 
which office.’
‘To the police? … What for? …’
‘How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.’
The man looked at him attentively, looked round the 
room and turned to go away.
‘He’s downright ill!’ observed Nastasya, not taking her 
eyes off him. The porter turned his head for a moment. ‘He’s 
been in a fever since yesterday,’ she added.
Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his 
hands, without opening it. ‘Don’t you get up then,’ Nastasya 
went on compassionately, seeing that he was letting his feet 
down from the sofa. ‘You’re ill, and so don’t go; there’s no 
such hurry. What have you got there?’
He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had 
cut from his trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. 
 139So he had been asleep with them in his hand. Afterwards 
reflecting upon it, he remembered that half waking up in 
his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so 
fallen asleep again.
‘Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as 
though he has got hold of a treasure …’
And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.
Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and 
fixed his eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being 
capable of rational reflection at that moment, he felt that no 
one would behave like that with a person who was going to 
be arrested. ‘But … the police?’
‘You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s 
some left.’
‘No … I’m going; I’ll go at once,’ he muttered, getting on 
to his feet.
‘Why, you’ll never get downstairs!’
‘Yes, I’ll go.’
‘As you please.’
She followed the porter out.
At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and 
the rags.
‘There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with 
dirt, and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had 
no suspicion could distinguish anything. Nastasya from a 
distance could not have noticed, thank God!’ Then with a 
tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he 
was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an 
ordinary summons from the district police-station to ap-
 Crime and Punishment
140
pear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district 
superintendent.
‘But when has such a thing happened? I never have 
anything to do with the police! And why just to-day?’ he 
thought in agonising bewilderment. ‘Good God, only get 
it over soon!’
He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke 
into laughter —not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.
He began, hurriedly dressing. ‘If I’m lost, I am lost, I 
don’t care! Shall I put the sock on?’ he suddenly wondered, 
‘it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone.’
But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again 
in loathing and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that 
he had no other socks, he picked it up and put it on again—
and again he laughed.
‘That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way 
of looking at it,’ he thought in a flash, but only on the top 
surface of his mind, while he was shuddering all over, ‘there, 
I’ve got it on! I have finished by getting it on!’
But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.
‘No, it’s too much for me …’ he thought. His legs shook. 
‘From fear,’ he muttered. His head swam and ached with fe-
ver. ‘It’s a trick! They want to decoy me there and confound 
me over everything,’ he mused, as he went out on to the 
stairs—‘the worst of it is I’m almost light-headed … I may 
blurt out something stupid …’
On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the 
things just as they were in the hole in the wall, ‘and very 
likely, it’s on purpose to search when I’m out,’ he thought, 
 141and stopped short. But he was possessed by such despair, 
such cynicism of misery, if one may so call it, that with a 
wave of his hand he went on. ‘Only to get it over!’
In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop 
of rain had fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and 
mortar, again the stench from the shops and pot-houses, 
again the drunken men, the Finnish pedlars and half-bro-
ken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes, so that 
it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going 
round—as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out 
into the street on a bright sunny day.
When he reached the turning into the street, in an agony 
of trepidation he looked down it … at the house … and at 
once averted his eyes.
‘If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,’ he thought, 
as he drew near the police-station.
The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It 
had lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a 
new house. He had been once for a moment in the old office 
but long ago. Turning in at the gateway, he saw on the right 
a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book 
in his hand. ‘A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is 
here,’ and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He 
did not want to ask questions of anyone.
‘I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything …’ he 
thought, as he reached the fourth floor.
The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty 
water. The kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and 
stood open almost the whole day. So there was a fearful 
 Crime and Punishment
142
smell and heat. The staircase was crowded with porters 
going up and down with their books under their arms, po-
licemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door 
of the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood wait-
ing within. There, too, the heat was stifling and there was 
a sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly 
decorated rooms.
After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into 
the next room. All the rooms were small and low-pitched. 
A fearful impatience drew him on and on. No one paid at-
tention to him. In the second room some clerks sat writing, 
dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a queer-look-
ing set. He went up to one of them.
‘What is it?’
He showed the notice he had received.
‘You are a student?’ the man asked, glancing at the no-
tice.
‘Yes, formerly a student.’
The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest inter-
est. He was a particularly unkempt person with the look of 
a fixed idea in his eye.
‘There would be no getting anything out of him, because 
he has no interest in anything,’ thought Raskolnikov.
‘Go in there to the head clerk,’ said the clerk, pointing to-
wards the furthest room.
He went into that room—the fourth in order; it was a 
small room and packed full of people, rather better dressed 
than in the outer rooms. Among them were two ladies. One, 
poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the table opposite the 
 143chief clerk, writing something at his dictation. The other, a 
very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face, 
excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as 
big as a saucer, was standing on one side, apparently wait-
ing for something. Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the 
head clerk. The latter glanced at it, said: ‘Wait a minute,’ and 
went on attending to the lady in mourning.
He breathed more freely. ‘It can’t be that!’
By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging 
himself to have courage and be calm.
‘Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may 
betray myself! Hm … it’s a pity there’s no air here,’ he add-
ed, ‘it’s stifling…. It makes one’s head dizzier than ever … 
and one’s mind too …’
He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was 
afraid of losing his self-control; he tried to catch at some-
thing and fix his mind on it, something quite irrelevant, but 
he could not succeed in this at all. Yet the head clerk great-
ly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him and 
guess something from his face.
He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a 
dark mobile face that looked older than his years. He was 
fashionably dressed and foppish, with his hair parted in the 
middle, well combed and pomaded, and wore a number of 
rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his 
waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner 
who was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.
‘Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,’ he said casually to the 
gaily- dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as 
 Crime and Punishment
144
though not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair 
beside her.
‘Ich danke,’ said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk 
she sank into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with 
white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and 
filled almost half the room. She smelt of scent. But she was 
obviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling 
so strongly of scent; and though her smile was impudent as 
well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.
The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All 
at once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jaun-
tily, with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step. He 
tossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an 
easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her seat 
on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; 
but the officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she 
did not venture to sit down again in his presence. He was 
the assistant superintendent. He had a reddish moustache 
that stood out horizontally on each side of his face, and ex-
tremely small features, expressive of nothing much except a 
certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignant-
ly at Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite 
of his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in 
keeping with his clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a 
very long and direct look on him, so that he felt positively 
affronted.
‘What do you want?’ he shouted, apparently astonished 
that such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the maj-
esty of his glance.
 145‘I was summoned … by a notice …’ Raskolnikov fal-
tered.
‘For the recovery of money due, from the student ’ the 
head clerk interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his 
papers. ‘Here!’ and he flung Raskolnikov a document and 
pointed out the place. ‘Read that!’
‘Money? What money?’ thought Raskolnikov, ‘but … 
then … it’s certainly not that. ’
And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense inde-
scribable relief. A load was lifted from his back.
‘And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?’ 
shouted the assistant superintendent, seeming for some un-
known reason more and more aggrieved. ‘You are told to 
come at nine, and now it’s twelve!’
‘The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour 
ago,’ Raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder. To his 
own surprise he, too, grew suddenly angry and found a cer-
tain pleasure in it. ‘And it’s enough that I have come here ill 
with fever.’
‘Kindly refrain from shouting!’
‘I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who 
are shouting at me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout 
at me.’
The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the 
first minute he could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped 
up from his seat.
‘Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be im-
pudent, sir!’
‘You’re in a government office, too,’ cried Raskolnikov, 
 Crime and Punishment
146
‘and you’re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you 
are showing disrespect to all of us.’
He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.
The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry as-
sistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted.
‘That’s not your business!’ he shouted at last with un-
natural loudness. ‘Kindly make the declaration demanded 
of you. Show him. Alexandr Grigorievitch. There is a com-
plaint against you! You don’t pay your debts! You’re a fine 
bird!’
But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly 
clutched at the paper, in haste to find an explanation. He 
read it once, and a second time, and still did not under-
stand.
‘What is this?’ he asked the head clerk.
‘It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You 
must either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give 
a written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same 
time an undertaking not to leave the capital without pay-
ment, and nor to sell or conceal your property. The creditor 
is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed against you 
according to the law.’
‘But I … am not in debt to anyone!’
‘That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred 
and fifteen roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, 
has been brought us for recovery, given by you to the widow 
of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine months ago, and paid over 
by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov. We therefore 
summon you, hereupon.’
 147‘But she is my landlady!’
‘And what if she is your landlady?’
The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile 
of compassion, and at the same time with a certain triumph, 
as at a novice under fire for the first time—as though he 
would say: ‘Well, how do you feel now?’ But what did he 
care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that worth 
worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, 
he read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions 
himself, but all mechanically. The triumphant sense of se-
curity, of deliverance from overwhelming danger, that was 
what filled his whole soul that moment without thought for 
the future, without analysis, without suppositions or sur-
mises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an 
instant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very 
moment something like a thunderstorm took place in the 
office. The assistant superintendent, still shaken by Raskol-
nikov’s disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to 
keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate 
smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came 
in with an exceedingly silly smile.
‘You shameful hussy!’ he shouted suddenly at the top of 
his voice. (The lady in mourning had left the office.) ‘What 
was going on at your house last night? Eh! A disgrace again, 
you’re a scandal to the whole street. Fighting and drinking 
again. Do you want the house of correction? Why, I have 
warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the 
eleventh! And here you are again, again, you … you … !’
The paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked 
 Crime and Punishment
148
wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treat-
ed. But he soon saw what it meant, and at once began to find 
positive amusement in the scandal. He listened with plea-
sure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh … all his nerves 
were on edge.
‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk was beginning anxiously, 
but stopped short, for he knew from experience that the en-
raged assistant could not be stopped except by force.
As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled be-
fore the storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and 
violent the terms of abuse became, the more amiable she 
looked, and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on 
the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and curtsied in-
cessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her 
word: and at last she found it.
‘There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. 
Captain,’ she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speak-
ing Russian confidently, though with a strong German 
accent, ‘and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, 
and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain, and I am 
not to blame…. Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain, 
and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, al-
ways dislike any scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, 
and asked for three bottles again, and then he lifted up one 
leg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and 
that is not at all right in an honourable house, and he ganz 
broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I 
said so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone 
with it. And then I called the porter, and Karl came, and he 
 149took Karl and hit him in the eye; and he hit Henriette in the 
eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the cheek. And it was so 
ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain, and I 
screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and 
stood in the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a dis-
grace. The idea of squealing like a little pig at the window 
into the street! Fie upon him! And Karl pulled him away 
from the window by his coat, and it is true, Mr. Captain, he 
tore sein rock. And then he shouted that man muss pay him 
fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, 
five roubles for sein rock. And he is an ungentlemanly visi-
tor and caused all the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, 
‘for I can write to all the papers about you.’’
‘Then he was an author?’
‘Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in 
an honourable house….’
‘Now then! Enough! I have told you already …’
‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk repeated significantly.
The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk 
slightly shook his head.
‘… So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, 
and I tell it you for the last time,’ the assistant went on. ‘If 
there is a scandal in your honourable house once again, I 
will put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite 
society. Do you hear? So a literary man, an author took five 
roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable house’? A nice set, 
these authors!’
And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. 
‘There was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too. An 
 Crime and Punishment
150
author had eaten his dinner and would not pay; ‘I’ll write 
a satire on you,’ says he. And there was another of them 
on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language 
to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and 
daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a con-
fectioner’s shop the other day. They are like that, authors, 
literary men, students, town-criers…. Pfoo! You get along! I 
shall look in upon you myself one day. Then you had better 
be careful! Do you hear?’
With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying 
in all directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at 
the door, she stumbled backwards against a good-looking 
officer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whis-
kers. This was the superintendent of the district himself, 
Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy 
almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she 
fluttered out of the office.
‘Again thunder and lightning—a hurricane!’ said 
Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a civil and friendly 
tone. ‘You are aroused again, you are fuming again! I heard 
it on the stairs!’
‘Well, what then!’ Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentle-
manly nonchalance; and he walked with some papers to 
another table, with a jaunty swing of his shoulders at each 
step. ‘Here, if you will kindly look: an author, or a student, 
has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given an I O 
U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constant-
ly being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to 
make a protest against my smoking in his presence! He be-
 151haves like a cad himself, and just look at him, please. Here’s 
the gentleman, and very attractive he is!’
‘Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off 
like powder, you can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took of-
fence at something and went too far yourself,’ continued 
Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to Raskolnikov. ‘But you 
were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure you, but ex-
plosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no 
stopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s 
a heart of gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Ex-
plosive Lieutenant….’
‘And what a regiment it was, too,’ cried Ilya Petrovitch, 
much gratified at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.
Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something ex-
ceptionally pleasant to them all. ‘Excuse me, Captain,’ he 
began easily, suddenly addressing Nikodim Fomitch, ‘will 
you enter into my position? … I am ready to ask pardon, if I 
have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick and shat-
tered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not 
studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get 
money…. I have a mother and sister in the province of X. 
They will send it to me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good- 
hearted woman, but she is so exasperated at my having lost 
my lessons, and not paying her for the last four months, that 
she does not even send up my dinner … and I don’t under-
stand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this I 
O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves! …’
‘But that is not our business, you know,’ the head clerk 
was observing.

‘Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to ex-
plain …’ Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim 
Fomitch, but trying his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, 
though the latter persistently appeared to be rummag-
ing among his papers and to be contemptuously oblivious 
of him. ‘Allow me to explain that I have been living with 
her for nearly three years and at first … at first … for why 
should I not confess it, at the very beginning I promised to 
marry her daughter, it was a verbal promise, freely given … 
she was a girl … indeed, I liked her, though I was not in love 
with her … a youthful affair in fact … that is, I mean to say, 
that my landlady gave me credit freely in those days, and I 
led a life of … I was very heedless …’
‘Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve 
no time to waste,’ Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and 
with a note of triumph; but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, 
though he suddenly found it exceedingly difficult to speak.
‘But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain … how 
it all happened … In my turn … though I agree with you 
… it is unnecessary. But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. 
I remained lodging there as before, and when my landlady 
moved into her present quarters, she said to me … and in a 
friendly way … that she had complete trust in me, but still, 
would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen 
roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her 
that, she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that 
she would never, never—those were her own words—make 
use of that I O U till I could pay of myself … and now, when 
I have lost my lessons and have nothing to eat, she takes ac-
 153tion against me. What am I to say to that?’
‘All these affecting details are no business of ours.’ Ilya 
Petrovitch interrupted rudely. ‘You must give a written un-
dertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic 
events, we have nothing to do with that.’
‘Come now … you are harsh,’ muttered Nikodim Fomi-
tch, sitting down at the table and also beginning to write. 
He looked a little ashamed.
‘Write!’ said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.
‘Write what?’ the latter asked, gruffly.
‘I will dictate to you.’
Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more 
casually and contemptuously after his speech, but strange 
to say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone’s 
opinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in one in-
stant. If he had cared to think a little, he would have been 
amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that 
a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where 
had those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had 
been filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest 
and dearest to him, he would not have found one human 
word for them, so empty was his heart. A gloomy sensa-
tion of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took 
conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his 
sentimental effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the mean-
ness of the latter’s triumph over him that had caused this 
sudden revulsion in his heart. Oh, what had he to do now 
with his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, offi-
cers, German women, debts, police- offices? If he had been 
 Crime and Punishment
154
sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have 
stirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end. 
Something was happening to him entirely new, sudden and 
unknown. It was not that he understood, but he felt clearly 
with all the intensity of sensation that he could never more 
appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental 
effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything what-
ever; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters 
and not police-officers, it would have been utterly out of the 
question to appeal to them in any circumstance of life. He 
had never experienced such a strange and awful sensation. 
And what was most agonising—it was more a sensation than 
a conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising 
of all the sensations he had known in his life.
The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of 
declaration, that he could not pay, that he undertook to do 
so at a future date, that he would not leave the town, nor sell 
his property, and so on.
‘But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,’ ob-
served the head clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. 
‘Are you ill?’
‘Yes, I am giddy. Go on!’
‘That’s all. Sign it.’
The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to 
others.
Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up 
and going away, he put his elbows on the table and pressed 
his head in his hands. He felt as if a nail were being driven 
into his skull. A strange idea suddenly occurred to him, to 
 155get up at once, to go up to Nikodim Fomitch, and tell him 
everything that had happened yesterday, and then to go 
with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the 
hole in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up 
from his seat to carry it out. ‘Hadn’t I better think a minute?’ 
flashed through his mind. ‘No, better cast off the burden 
without thinking.’ But all at once he stood still, rooted to 
the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly with Ilya 
Petrovitch, and the words reached him:
‘It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, 
the whole story contradicts itself. Why should they have 
called the porter, if it had been their doing? To inform 
against themselves? Or as a blind? No, that would be too 
cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the 
gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He 
was walking with three friends, who left him only at the 
gate, and he asked the porters to direct him, in the pres-
ence of the friends. Now, would he have asked his way if he 
had been going with such an object? As for Koch, he spent 
half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went up to 
the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. 
Now just consider …’
‘But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? 
They state themselves that they knocked and the door was 
locked; yet three minutes later when they went up with the 
porter, it turned out the door was unfastened.’
‘That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and 
bolted himself in; and they’d have caught him for a certain-
ty if Koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter 
 Crime and Punishment
156
too. He must have seized the interval to get downstairs and 
slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing himself and 
saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and 
killed me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving 
service—ha, ha!’
‘And no one saw the murderer?’
‘They might well not see him; the house is a regular No-
ah’s Ark,’ said the head clerk, who was listening.
‘It’s clear, quite clear,’ Nikodim Fomitch repeated warm-
ly.
‘No, it is anything but clear,’ Ilya Petrovitch maintained.
Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the 
door, but he did not reach it….
When he recovered consciousness, he found himself 
sitting in a chair, supported by someone on the right side, 
while someone else was standing on the left, holding a yel-
lowish glass filled with yellow water, and Nikodim Fomitch 
standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up 
from the chair.
‘What’s this? Are you ill?’ Nikodim Fomitch asked, rath-
er sharply.
‘He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,’ said 
the head clerk, settling back in his place, and taking up his 
work again.
‘Have you been ill long?’ cried Ilya Petrovitch from his 
place, where he, too, was looking through papers. He had, 
of course, come to look at the sick man when he fainted, but 
retired at once when he recovered.
‘Since yesterday,’ muttered Raskolnikov in reply.
 157‘Did you go out yesterday?’
‘Yes.’
‘Though you were ill?’
‘Yes.’
‘At what time?’
‘About seven.’
‘And where did you go, my I ask?’
‘Along the street.’
‘Short and clear.’
Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered 
sharply, jerkily, without dropping his black feverish eyes 
before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare.
‘He can scarcely stand upright. And you …’ Nikodim 
Fomitch was beginning.
‘No matter,’ Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiar-
ly.
Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further pro-
test, but glancing at the head clerk who was looking very 
hard at him, he did not speak. There was a sudden silence. 
It was strange.
‘Very well, then,’ concluded Ilya Petrovitch, ‘we will not 
detain you.’
Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager 
conversation on his departure, and above the rest rose the 
questioning voice of Nikodim Fomitch. In the street, his 
faintness passed off completely.
‘A search—there will be a search at once,’ he repeated to 
himself, hurrying home. ‘The brutes! they suspect.’
His former terror mastered him completely again.

## Chapter 2

‘A
nd what if there has been a search already? What if I 
find them in my room?’
But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one 
had peeped in. Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heav-
ens! how could he have left all those things in the hole?
He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the pa-
per, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them. 
There were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings 
or something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four 
small leather cases. There was a chain, too, merely wrapped 
in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked 
like a decoration…. He put them all in the different pockets 
of his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, 
trying to conceal them as much as possible. He took the 
purse, too. Then he went out of his room, leaving the door 
open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt 
shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of 
pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another 
quarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued 
for his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces 
before then. He must clear everything up while he still had 
some strength, some reasoning power left him…. Where 
was he to go?
That had long been settled: ‘Fling them into the canal, 
 159and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an 
end.’ So he had decided in the night of his delirium when 
several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, 
to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get rid of it, turned 
out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along the bank 
of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and 
looked several times at the steps running down to the wa-
ter, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either 
rafts stood at the steps’ edge, and women were washing 
clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people 
were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and 
noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspi-
cious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw 
something into the water. And what if the boxes were to 
float instead of sinking? And of course they would. Even as 
it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as 
if they had nothing to do but to watch him. ‘Why is it, or 
can it be my fancy?’ he thought.
At last the thought struck him that it might be better to 
go to the Neva. There were not so many people there, he 
would be less observed, and it would be more convenient 
in every way, above all it was further off. He wondered how 
he could have been wandering for a good half- hour, wor-
ried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking 
of it before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irratio-
nal plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium! 
He had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was 
aware of it. He certainly must make haste.
He walked towards the Neva along V—— Prospect, but 
 Crime and Punishment
160
on the way another idea struck him. ‘Why to the Neva? 
Would it not be better to go somewhere far off, to the Is-
lands again, and there hide the things in some solitary place, 
in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot perhaps?’ And 
though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea seemed 
to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. 
For coming out of V—— Prospect towards the square, he 
saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to 
a courtyard. On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed 
wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on 
the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twen-
ty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. 
Here was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of dif-
ferent sorts was lying. At the end of the court, the corner of 
a low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some work-
shop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It was probably a 
carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place from 
the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the 
place to throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, 
he slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as 
is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-
drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in 
chalk the time-honoured witticism, ‘Standing here strictly 
forbidden.’ This was all the better, for there would be noth-
ing suspicious about his going in. ‘Here I could throw it all 
in a heap and get away!’
Looking round once more, with his hand already in his 
pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the en-
trance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps 
 161sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He 
could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but 
he could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone 
came in from the street, which might well happen indeed, 
so there was need of haste.
He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in 
both hands, and using all his strength turned it over. Under 
the stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he immedi-
ately emptied his pocket into it. The purse lay at the top, and 
yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he seized the stone 
again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the 
same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But 
he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with 
his foot. Nothing could be noticed.
Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an 
intense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an in-
stant, as it had in the police-office. ‘I have buried my tracks! 
And who, who can think of looking under that stone? It has 
been lying there most likely ever since the house was built, 
and will lie as many years more. And if it were found, who 
would think of me? It is all over! No clue!’ And he laughed. 
Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous 
noiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was 
crossing the square. But when he reached the K—— Bou-
levard where two days before he had come upon that girl, 
his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his 
mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass 
that seat on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and 
pondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that 
 Crime and Punishment
162
whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty co-
pecks: ‘Damn him!’
He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. 
All his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single 
point, and he felt that there really was such a point, and that 
now, now, he was left facing that point—and for the first 
time, indeed, during the last two months.
‘Damn it all!’ he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovern-
able fury. ‘If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new 
life! Good Lord, how stupid it is! … And what lies I told 
to-day! How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya 
Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for them all, 
and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It is not 
that at all!’
Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and 
exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly con-
founded him.
‘If it all has really been done deliberately and not idioti-
cally, if I really had a certain and definite object, how is it 
I did not even glance into the purse and don’t know what I 
had there, for which I have undergone these agonies, and 
have deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading 
business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the water 
the purse together with all the things which I had not seen 
either … how’s that?’
Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all 
before, and it was not a new question for him, even when 
it was decided in the night without hesitation and con-
sideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not 
 163possibly be otherwise…. Yes, he had known it all, and un-
derstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday 
at the moment when he was bending over the box and pull-
ing the jewel-cases out of it…. Yes, so it was.
‘It is because I am very ill,’ he decided grimly at last, ‘I 
have been worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know 
what I am doing…. Yesterday and the day before yesterday 
and all this time I have been worrying myself…. I shall get 
well and I shall not worry…. But what if I don’t get well at 
all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!’
He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing 
for some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what 
to attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining 
more and more mastery over him every moment; this was 
an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything 
surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred. 
All who met him were loathsome to him—he loathed their 
faces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had ad-
dressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten 
him….
He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the 
Little Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. ‘Why, 
he lives here, in that house,’ he thought, ‘why, I have not 
come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here it’s the same 
thing over again…. Very interesting to know, though; have 
I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? 
Never mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go 
and see him the day after; well, and so I will! Besides I really 
cannot go further now.’
 Crime and Punishment
164
He went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.
The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at 
the moment, and he opened the door himself. It was four 
months since they had seen each other. Razumihin was sit-
ting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on his bare 
feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed 
surprise.
‘Is it you?’ he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; 
then after a brief pause, he whistled. ‘As hard up as all that! 
Why, brother, you’ve cut me out!’ he added, looking at 
Raskolnikov’s rags. ‘Come sit down, you are tired, I’ll be 
bound.’
And when he had sunk down on the American leather 
sofa, which was in even worse condition than his own, Ra-
zumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill.
‘Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?’ He began 
feeling his pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.
‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have come for this: I have no les-
sons…. I wanted, … but I don’t really want lessons….’
‘But I say! You are delirious, you know!’ Razumihin ob-
served, watching him carefully.
‘No, I am not.’
Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted 
the stairs to Razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would 
be meeting his friend face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, 
that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment 
was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world. His 
spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at him-
self as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.
 165‘Good-bye,’ he said abruptly, and walked to the door.
‘Stop, stop! You queer fish.’
‘I don’t want to,’ said the other, again pulling away his 
hand.
‘Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or 
what? Why, this is … almost insulting! I won’t let you go 
like that.’
‘Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but 
you who could help … to begin … because you are kinder 
than anyone— cleverer, I mean, and can judge … and now 
I see that I want nothing. Do you hear? Nothing at all … no 
one’s services … no one’s sympathy. I am by myself … alone. 
Come, that’s enough. Leave me alone.’
‘Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As 
you like for all I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I 
don’t care about that, but there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov—
and he takes the place of a lesson. I would not exchange him 
for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a kind, and issuing 
natural science manuals and what a circulation they have! 
The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained 
that I was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools 
than I am! Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that 
he has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage 
him. Here are two signatures of the German text—in my 
opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, 
‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly 
proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this 
work as a contribution to the woman question; I am trans-
lating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures 
 Crime and Punishment
166
into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long 
and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He pays me six 
roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles 
for the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we 
have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about 
whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the sec-
ond part of Les Confessions we have marked for translation; 
somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of 
Radishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang 
him! Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘Is 
woman a human being?’ If you would, take the German and 
pens and paper—all those are provided, and take three rou-
bles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole 
thing, three roubles come to you for your share. And when 
you have finished the signature there will be another three 
roubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a 
service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw 
how you could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spell-
ing, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly adrift in German, 
so that I make it up as I go along for the most part. The 
only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better. 
Though who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. 
Will you take it?’
Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took 
the three roubles and without a word went out. Razumihin 
gazed after him in astonishment. But when Raskolnikov 
was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs 
to Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German 
article and the three roubles, went out again, still without 
 167uttering a word.
‘Are you raving, or what?’ Razumihin shouted, roused to 
fury at last. ‘What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too … 
what did you come to see me for, damn you?’
‘I don’t want … translation,’ muttered Raskolnikov from 
the stairs.
‘Then what the devil do you want?’ shouted Razumihin 
from above. Raskolnikov continued descending the stair-
case in silence.
‘Hey, there! Where are you living?’
No answer.
‘Well, confound you then!’
But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On 
the Nikolaevsky Bridge he was roused to full consciousness 
again by an unpleasant incident. A coachman, after shout-
ing at him two or three times, gave him a violent lash on 
the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under his 
horses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed 
away to the railing (for some unknown reason he had been 
walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic). He 
angrily clenched and ground his teeth. He heard laughter, 
of course.
‘Serves him right!’
‘A pickpocket I dare say.’
‘Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the 
wheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him.’
‘It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.’
But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and 
bewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his 
 Crime and Punishment
168
back, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand. 
He looked. It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goat-
skin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter wearing a hat, 
and carrying a green parasol.
‘Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.’
He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty 
copecks. From his dress and appearance they might well 
have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and 
the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow, 
which made them feel sorry for him.
He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for 
ten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the 
palace. The sky was without a cloud and the water was al-
most bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva. The cupola of 
the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about 
twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and 
in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distin-
guished. The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov 
forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occu-
pied him now completely. He stood still, and gazed long and 
intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar 
to him. When he was attending the university, he had hun-
dreds of times—generally on his way home—stood still on 
this spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and al-
most always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion 
it roused in him. It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous 
picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered every 
time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrust-
ing himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly 
 169recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to 
him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. 
It struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have 
stopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually 
imagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested 
in the same theories and pictures that had interested him 
… so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it 
wrung his heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all 
that seemed to him now—all his old past, his old thoughts, 
his old problems and theories, his old impressions and that 
picture and himself and all, all…. He felt as though he were 
flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his 
sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he 
suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He 
opened his hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his 
arm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home. 
It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and 
from everything at that moment.
Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that 
he must have been walking about six hours. How and where 
he came back he did not remember. Undressing, and quiver-
ing like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the sofa, drew 
his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion….
It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. 
Good God, what a scream! Such unnatural sounds, such 
howling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he had 
never heard.
He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. 
In terror he sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But 
 Crime and Punishment
170
the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder. 
And then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of 
his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and wailing, rap-
idly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out 
what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, 
not to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on 
the stairs. The voice of her assailant was so horrible from 
spite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he, too, was 
saying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hur-
rying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he 
recognised the voice—it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya 
Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her, 
banging her head against the steps—that’s clear, that can 
be told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How 
is it, is the world topsy-turvy? He could hear people run-
ning in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he 
heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging. ‘But 
why, why, and how could it be?’ he repeated, thinking seri-
ously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! 
And they would come to him then next, ‘for no doubt … it’s 
all about that … about yesterday…. Good God!’ He would 
have fastened his door with the latch, but he could not lift 
his hand … besides, it would be useless. Terror gripped his 
heart like ice, tortured him and numbed him…. But at last 
all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes, began 
gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groan-
ing; Ilya Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses…. 
But at last he, too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not 
be heard. ‘Can he have gone away? Good Lord!’ Yes, and 
 171now the landlady is going too, still weeping and moaning 
… and then her door slammed…. Now the crowd was go-
ing from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, 
calling to one another, raising their voices to a shout, drop-
ping them to a whisper. There must have been numbers of 
them—almost all the inmates of the block. ‘But, good God, 
how could it be! And why, why had he come here!’
Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not 
close his eyes. He lay for half an hour in such anguish, such 
an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never 
experienced before. Suddenly a bright light flashed into his 
room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup. 
Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not 
asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out 
what she had brought—bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.
‘You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve 
been trudging about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.’
‘Nastasya … what were they beating the landlady for?’
She looked intently at him.
‘Who beat the landlady?’
‘Just now … half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assis-
tant superintendent, on the stairs…. Why was he ill-treating 
her like that, and … why was he here?’
Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her 
scrutiny lasted a long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened 
at her searching eyes.
‘Nastasya, why don’t you speak?’ he said timidly at last 
in a weak voice.
‘It’s the blood,’ she answered at last softly, as though 
 Crime and Punishment
172
speaking to herself.
‘Blood? What blood?’ he muttered, growing white and 
turning towards the wall.
Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.
‘Nobody has been beating the landlady,’ she declared at 
last in a firm, resolute voice.
He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.
‘I heard it myself…. I was not asleep … I was sitting up,’ 
he said still more timidly. ‘I listened a long while. The as-
sistant superintendent came…. Everyone ran out on to the 
stairs from all the flats.’
‘No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your 
ears. When there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you 
begin fancying things…. Will you eat something?’
He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, 
watching him.
‘Give me something to drink … Nastasya.’
She went downstairs and returned with a white earthen-
ware jug of water. He remembered only swallowing one sip 
of the cold water and spilling some on his neck. Then fol-
lowed forgetfulness.

## Chapter 3

H
e was not completely unconscious, however, all the 
time he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes 
delirious, sometimes half conscious. He remembered a great 
deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though there were 
a number of people round him; they wanted to take him 
away somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and 
discussing about him. Then he would be alone in the room; 
they had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and 
then opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened 
him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at 
him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he dis-
tinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know 
very well, though he could not remember who he was, and 
this fretted him, even made him cry. Sometimes he fancied 
he had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed 
part of the same day. But of that—of that he had no recol-
lection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten 
something he ought to remember. He worried and torment-
ed himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, 
or sank into awful, intolerable terror. Then he struggled to 
get up, would have run away, but someone always prevented 
him by force, and he sank back into impotence and forget-
fulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.
It happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days 
 Crime and Punishment
174
the sun shone into the room at that hour, throwing a streak 
of light on the right wall and the corner near the door. 
Nastasya was standing beside him with another person, a 
complete stranger, who was looking at him very inquisi-
tively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, 
short- waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The land-
lady was peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov 
sat up.
‘Who is this, Nastasya?’ he asked, pointing to the young 
man.
‘I say, he’s himself again!’ she said.
‘He is himself,’ echoed the man.
Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the land-
lady closed the door and disappeared. She was always shy 
and dreaded conversations or discussions. She was a wom-
an of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black 
eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, 
and absurdly bashful.
‘Who … are you?’ he went on, addressing the man. But at 
that moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, 
as he was so tall, Razumihin came in.
‘What a cabin it is!’ he cried. ‘I am always knocking my 
head. You call this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? 
I’ve just heard the news from Pashenka.’
‘He has just come to,’ said Nastasya.
‘Just come to,’ echoed the man again, with a smile.
‘And who are you?’ Razumihin asked, suddenly ad-
dressing him. ‘My name is Vrazumihin, at your service; 
not Razumihin, as I am always called, but Vrazumihin, a 
 175student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are 
you?’
‘I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant 
Shelopaev, and I’ve come on business.’
‘Please sit down.’ Razumihin seated himself on the other 
side of the table. ‘It’s a good thing you’ve come to, broth-
er,’ he went on to Raskolnikov. ‘For the last four days you 
have scarcely eaten or drunk anything. We had to give you 
tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see you twice. You 
remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said 
at once it was nothing serious—something seemed to have 
gone to your head. Some nervous nonsense, the result of 
bad feeding, he says you have not had enough beer and rad-
ish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you will be all 
right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a 
name. Come, I won’t keep you,’ he said, addressing the man 
again. ‘Will you explain what you want? You must know, 
Rodya, this is the second time they have sent from the office; 
but it was another man last time, and I talked to him. Who 
was it came before?’
‘That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you 
please, sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our of-
fice, too.’
‘He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?’
‘Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.’
‘Quite so; go on.’
‘At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch 
Vahrushin, of whom I presume you have heard more than 
once, a remittance is sent to you from our office,’ the man 
 Crime and Punishment
176
began, addressing Raskolnikov. ‘If you are in an intelli-
gible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as 
Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivano-
vitch at your mamma’s request instructions to that effect, as 
on previous occasions. Do you know him, sir?’
‘Yes, I remember … Vahrushin,’ Raskolnikov said dream-
ily.
‘You hear, he knows Vahrushin,’ cried Razumihin. ‘He 
is in ‘an intelligible condition’! And I see you are an intel-
ligent man too. Well, it’s always pleasant to hear words of 
wisdom.’
‘That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. 
And at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a 
remittance once before in the same manner through him, 
he did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to 
Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-
five roubles in the hope of better to come.’
‘That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve 
said, though ‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, 
what do you say? Is he fully conscious, eh?’
‘That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.’
‘He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?’
‘Yes, here’s the book.’
‘Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the 
pen and scribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, broth-
er, money is sweeter to us than treacle.’
‘I don’t want it,’ said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.
‘Not want it?’
‘I won’t sign it.’
 177‘How the devil can you do without signing it?’
‘I don’t want … the money.’
‘Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, 
I bear witness. Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on 
his travels again. But that’s pretty common with him at all 
times though…. You are a man of judgment and we will 
take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his hand and he 
will sign it. Here.’
‘But I can come another time.’
‘No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of 
judgment…. Now, Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see 
he is waiting,’ and he made ready to hold Raskolnikov’s 
hand in earnest.
‘Stop, I’ll do it alone,’ said the latter, taking the pen and 
signing his name.
The messenger took out the money and went away.
‘Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?’
‘Yes,’ answered Raskolnikov.
‘Is there any soup?’
‘Some of yesterday’s,’ answered Nastasya, who was still 
standing there.
‘With potatoes and rice in it?’
‘Yes.’
‘I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.’
‘Very well.’
Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonish-
ment and a dull, unreasoning terror. He made up his mind 
to keep quiet and see what would happen. ‘I believe I am not 
wandering. I believe it’s reality,’ he thought.
 Crime and Punishment
178
In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, 
and announced that the tea would be ready directly. With 
the soup she brought two spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, 
mustard for the beef, and so on. The table was set as it had 
not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.
‘It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlov-
na were to send us up a couple of bottles of beer. We could 
empty them.’
‘Well, you are a cool hand,’ muttered Nastasya, and she 
departed to carry out his orders.
Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. 
Meanwhile Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as 
clumsily as a bear put his left arm round Raskolnikov’s head, 
although he was able to sit up, and with his right hand gave 
him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that it might not burn 
him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov swal-
lowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. 
But after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumi-
hin suddenly stopped, and said that he must ask Zossimov 
whether he ought to have more.
Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
‘And will you have tea?’
‘Yes.’
‘Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may 
venture on without the faculty. But here is the beer!’ He 
moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front 
of him, and began eating as though he had not touched food 
for three days.
‘I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day 
 179now,’ he mumbled with his mouth full of beef, ‘and it’s all 
Pashenka, your dear little landlady, who sees to that; she 
loves to do anything for me. I don’t ask for it, but, of course, 
I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya with the tea. She is a 
quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have some beer?’
‘Get along with your nonsense!’
‘A cup of tea, then?’
‘A cup of tea, maybe.’
‘Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.’
He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the 
sofa again. As before, he put his left arm round the sick 
man’s head, raised him up and gave him tea in spoon-
fuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and earnestly, 
as though this process was the principal and most effec-
tive means towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said 
nothing and made no resistance, though he felt quite strong 
enough to sit up on the sofa without support and could not 
merely have held a cup or a spoon, but even perhaps could 
have walked about. But from some queer, almost animal, 
cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and 
lying low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet 
in full possession of his faculties, and meanwhile listening 
to find out what was going on. Yet he could not overcome 
his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of 
tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away 
capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actu-
ally real pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean 
cases, he observed that, too, and took note of it.
‘Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to 
 Crime and Punishment
180
make him some raspberry tea,’ said Razumihin, going back 
to his chair and attacking his soup and beer again.
‘And where is she to get raspberries for you?’ asked Nas-
tasya, balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and 
sipping tea through a lump of sugar.
‘She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts 
of things have been happening while you have been laid up. 
When you decamped in that rascally way without leaving 
your address, I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out 
and punish you. I set to work that very day. How I ran about 
making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had for-
gotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I 
did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only 
remember it was at the Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. I 
kept trying to find that Harlamov’s house, and afterwards 
it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but Buch’s. How 
one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and 
I went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and 
only fancy, in two minutes they looked you up! Your name 
is down there.’
‘My name!’
‘I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could 
not find while I was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon 
as I did land on this place, I soon got to know all your af-
fairs—all, all, brother, I know everything; Nastasya here 
will tell you. I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch 
and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house- porter and Mr. Zame-
tov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police 
office, and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here 
 181knows….’
‘He’s got round her,’ Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.
‘Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Ni-
kiforovna?’
‘You are a one!’ Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a 
giggle. ‘I am not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,’ she added sud-
denly, recovering from her mirth.
‘I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story 
short, I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot 
all malignant influences in the locality, but Pashenka won 
the day. I had not expected, brother, to find her so … pre-
possessing. Eh, what do you think?’
Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed 
upon him, full of alarm.
‘And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,’ 
Razumihin went on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.
‘Ah, the sly dog!’ Nastasya shrieked again. This conversa-
tion afforded her unspeakable delight.
‘It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the 
right way at first. You ought to have approached her differ-
ently. She is, so to speak, a most unaccountable character. 
But we will talk about her character later…. How could 
you let things come to such a pass that she gave up send-
ing you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been 
mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when 
her daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive? … I know all 
about it! But I see that’s a delicate matter and I am an ass; 
forgive me. But, talking of foolishness, do you know Pras-
kovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think 
 Crime and Punishment
182
at first sight?’
‘No,’ mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling 
that it was better to keep up the conversation.
‘She isn’t, is she?’ cried Razumihin, delighted to get an 
answer out of him. ‘But she is not very clever either, eh? She 
is essentially, essentially an unaccountable character! I am 
sometimes quite at a loss, I assure you…. She must be forty; 
she says she is thirty- six, and of course she has every right 
to say so. But I swear I judge her intellectually, simply from 
the metaphysical point of view; there is a sort of symbol-
ism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not! I 
don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing 
that you are not a student now and have lost your lessons 
and your clothes, and that through the young lady’s death 
she has no need to treat you as a relation, she suddenly took 
fright; and as you hid in your den and dropped all your old 
relations with her, she planned to get rid of you. And she’s 
been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to 
lose the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother 
would pay.’
‘It was base of me to say that…. My mother herself is al-
most a beggar … and I told a lie to keep my lodging … and 
be fed,’ Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.
‘Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at 
that point Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pash-
enka would never have thought of doing anything on her 
own account, she is too retiring; but the business man is 
by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the question, 
‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is, 
 183because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with 
her hundred and twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to 
starve herself; and a sister, too, who would go into bondage 
for his sake. That’s what he was building upon…. Why do 
you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs now, my 
dear boy—it’s not for nothing that you were so open with 
Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and 
I say all this as a friend…. But I tell you what it is; an hon-
est and sensitive man is open; and a business man ‘listens 
and goes on eating’ you up. Well, then she gave the I O U by 
way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without hesitation 
he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all 
this I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, 
but by that time harmony reigned between me and Pash-
enka, and I insisted on stopping the whole affair, engaging 
that you would pay. I went security for you, brother. Do you 
understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten roubles 
and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the hon-
our of presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, 
take it, you see I have torn it.’
Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked 
at him and turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even 
Razumihin felt a twinge.
‘I see, brother,’ he said a moment later, ‘that I have been 
playing the fool again. I thought I should amuse you with 
my chatter, and I believe I have only made you cross.’
‘Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?’ 
Raskolnikov asked, after a moment’s pause without turn-
ing his head.
 Crime and Punishment
184
‘Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I 
brought Zametov one day.’
‘Zametov? The head clerk? What for?’ Raskolnikov 
turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.
‘What’s the matter with you? … What are you upset 
about? He wanted to make your acquaintance because I 
talked to him a lot about you…. How could I have found 
out so much except from him? He is a capital fellow, brother, 
first-rate … in his own way, of course. Now we are friends—
see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part, 
you know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to 
Luise Ivanovna once or twice…. Do you remember Luise, 
Luise Ivanovna?
‘Did I say anything in delirium?’
‘I should think so! You were beside yourself.’
‘What did I rave about?’
‘What next? What did you rave about? What people do 
rave about…. Well, brother, now I must not lose time. To 
work.’ He got up from the table and took up his cap.
‘What did I rave about?’
‘How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some 
secret? Don’t worry yourself; you said nothing about a 
countess. But you said a lot about a bulldog, and about ear-
rings and chains, and about Krestovsky Island, and some 
porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the assis-
tant superintendent. And another thing that was of special 
interest to you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me 
my sock.’ Zametov hunted all about your room for your 
socks, and with his own scented, ring-bedecked fingers he 
 185gave you the rag. And only then were you comforted, and 
for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched thing 
in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely 
somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you 
asked so piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to 
find out what sort of fringe, but we could not make it out. 
Now to business! Here are thirty-five roubles; I take ten of 
them, and shall give you an account of them in an hour or 
two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time, though he 
ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And 
you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see 
whether he wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell 
Pashenka what is wanted myself. Good-bye!’
‘He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!’ said Nas-
tasya as he went out; then she opened the door and stood 
listening, but could not resist running downstairs after him. 
She was very eager to hear what he would say to the land-
lady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.
No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung 
off the bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With 
burning, twitching impatience he had waited for them to be 
gone so that he might set to work. But to what work? Now, 
as though to spite him, it eluded him.
‘Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it 
yet or not? What if they know it and are only pretending, 
mocking me while I am laid up, and then they will come 
in and tell me that it’s been discovered long ago and that 
they have only … What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve 
forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I 
 Crime and Punishment
186
remembered a minute ago.’
He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in misera-
ble bewilderment about him; he walked to the door, opened 
it, listened; but that was not what he wanted. Suddenly, as 
though recalling something, he rushed to the corner where 
there was a hole under the paper, began examining it, put 
his hand into the hole, fumbled—but that was not it. He 
went to the stove, opened it and began rummaging in the 
ashes; the frayed edges of his trousers and the rags cut off 
his pocket were lying there just as he had thrown them. No 
one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock about 
which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it 
lay on the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with 
dust and grime that Zametov could not have seen anything 
on it.
‘Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for 
to the police office? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it 
up; that was then. I looked at my sock then, too, but now … 
now I have been ill. But what did Zametov come for? Why 
did Razumihin bring him?’ he muttered, helplessly sitting 
on the sofa again. ‘What does it mean? Am I still in deliri-
um, or is it real? I believe it is real…. Ah, I remember; I must 
escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! 
Yes … but where? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. 
They’ve taken them away! They’ve hidden them! I under-
stand! Ah, here is my coat—they passed that over! And here 
is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U … 
I’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They 
won’t find me! … Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find 
 187me, Razumihin will find me. Better escape altogether … far 
away … to America, and let them do their worst! And take 
the I O U … it would be of use there…. What else shall I 
take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk, 
ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about 
it! If only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set 
a watch there—policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is 
beer left, half a bottle, cold!’
He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful 
of beer, and gulped it down with relish, as though quench-
ing a flame in his breast. But in another minute the beer had 
gone to his head, and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran 
down his spine. He lay down and pulled the quilt over him. 
His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more dis-
connected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon 
him. With a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the 
pillow, wrapped more closely about him the soft, wadded 
quilt which had replaced the old, ragged greatcoat, sighed 
softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing sleep.
He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his 
eyes and saw Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncer-
tain whether to come in or not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly 
on the sofa and gazed at him, as though trying to recall 
something.
‘Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the 
parcel!’ Razumihin shouted down the stairs. ‘You shall have 
the account directly.’
‘What time is it?’ asked Raskolnikov, looking round un-
easily.

‘Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, 
it will be six o’clock directly. You have slept more than six 
hours.’
‘Good heavens! Have I?’
‘And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A 
tryst, is it? We’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for 
the last three hours for you; I’ve been up twice and found 
you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov twice; not at home, only 
fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And I’ve been out on 
my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day, 
moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. 
But that’s no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nas-
tasya. We will open it directly. And how do you feel now, 
brother?’
‘I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been 
here long?’
‘I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.’
‘No, before.’
‘How do you mean?’
‘How long have you been coming here?’
‘Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you re-
member?’
Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a 
dream to him. He could not remember alone, and looked 
inquiringly at Razumihin.
‘Hm!’ said the latter, ‘he has forgotten. I fancied then that 
you were not quite yourself. Now you are better for your 
sleep…. You really look much better. First-rate! Well, to 
business. Look here, my dear boy.’
 189He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested 
him.
‘Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my 
heart. For we must make a man of you. Let’s begin from the 
top. Do you see this cap?’ he said, taking out of the bundle 
a fairly good though cheap and ordinary cap. ‘Let me try it 
on.’
‘Presently, afterwards,’ said Raskolnikov, waving it off
 
pettishly.
‘Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be 
too late; and I shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, 
without measure. Just right!’ he cried triumphantly, fitting it 
on, ‘just your size! A proper head-covering is the first thing 
in dress and a recommendation in its own way. Tolstyakov, 
a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his pudding 
basin when he goes into any public place where other peo-
ple wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from 
slavish politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of 
his bird’s nest; he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, 
here are two specimens of headgear: this Palmerston’—he 
took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old, battered hat, which 
for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston—‘or this 
jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid 
for it, Nastasya!’ he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskol-
nikov did not speak.
‘Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,’ answered Nasta-
sya.
‘Twenty copecks, silly!’ he cried, offended. ‘Why, nowa-
days you would cost more than that—eighty copecks! And 
 Crime and Punishment
190
that only because it has been worn. And it’s bought on con-
dition that when’s it’s worn out, they will give you another 
next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to the 
United States of America, as they called them at school. I 
assure you I am proud of these breeches,’ and he exhibit-
ed to Raskolnikov a pair of light, summer trousers of grey 
woollen material. ‘No holes, no spots, and quite respectable, 
although a little worn; and a waistcoat to match, quite in 
the fashion. And its being worn really is an improvement, 
it’s softer, smoother…. You see, Rodya, to my thinking, the 
great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to 
the seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in Janu-
ary, you keep your money in your purse; and it’s the same 
with this purchase. It’s summer now, so I’ve been buying 
summer things— warmer materials will be wanted for au-
tumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case … 
especially as they will be done for by then from their own 
lack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. 
Come, price them! What do you say? Two roubles twen-
ty-five copecks! And remember the condition: if you wear 
these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only 
do business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a 
thing once, you are satisfied for life, for you will never go 
there again of your own free will. Now for the boots. What 
do you say? You see that they are a bit worn, but they’ll last 
a couple of months, for it’s foreign work and foreign leather; 
the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week—
he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of 
cash. Price—a rouble and a half. A bargain?’
 191‘But perhaps they won’t fit,’ observed Nastasya.
‘Not fit? Just look!’ and he pulled out of his pocket Raskol-
nikov’s old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. ‘I did 
not go empty- handed—they took the size from this mon-
ster. We all did our best. And as to your linen, your landlady 
has seen to that. Here, to begin with are three shirts, hemp-
en but with a fashionable front…. Well now then, eighty 
copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the suit—
together three roubles five copecks—a rouble and a half 
for the boots—for, you see, they are very good—and that 
makes four roubles fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the 
underclothes—they were bought in the lo— which makes 
exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks. Forty-five copecks 
change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya, you are 
set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will 
serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from get-
ting one’s clothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and 
other things, I leave them to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles 
left. And as for Pashenka and paying for your lodging, don’t 
you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for anything. And now, 
brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you will 
throw off your illness with your shirt.’
‘Let me be! I don’t want to!’ Raskolnikov waved him off. 
He had listened with disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be 
playful about his purchases.
‘Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around 
for nothing,’ Razumihin insisted. ‘Nastasya, don’t be bash-
ful, but help me—that’s it,’ and in spite of Raskolnikov’s 
resistance he changed his linen. The latter sank back on the 
 Crime and Punishment
192
pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.
‘It will be long before I get rid of them,’ he thought. ‘What 
money was all that bought with?’ he asked at last, gazing at 
the wall.
‘Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought 
from Vahrushin, your mother sent it. Have you forgotten 
that, too?’
‘I remember now,’ said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen 
silence. Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.
The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance 
seemed familiar to Raskolnikov came in.

## Chapter 4

Z
ossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-
shaven face and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, 
and a big gold ring on his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. 
He had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light sum-
mer trousers, and everything about him loose, fashionable 
and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his watch-
chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were, 
nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; 
he made efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was 
apparent at every instant. All his acquaintances found him 
tedious, but said he was clever at his work.
‘I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come 
to himself,’ cried Razumihin.
‘I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?’ said Zossimov 
to Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down 
at the foot of the sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as 
he could.
‘He is still depressed,’ Razumihin went on. ‘We’ve just 
changed his linen and he almost cried.’
‘That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did 
not wish it…. His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still ach-
ing, eh?’
‘I am well, I am perfectly well!’ Raskolnikov declared 
positively and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and 
 Crime and Punishment
194
looked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the 
pillow at once and turned to the wall. Zossimov watched 
him intently.
‘Very good…. Going on all right,’ he said lazily. ‘Has he 
eaten anything?’
They told him, and asked what he might have.
‘He may have anything … soup, tea … mushrooms and 
cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he’d better 
not have meat either, and … but no need to tell you that!’ 
Razumihin and he looked at each other. ‘No more medicine 
or anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow. Perhaps, to-
day even … but never mind …’
‘To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,’ said Ra-
zumihin. ‘We are going to the Yusupov garden and then to 
the Palais de Crystal.’
‘I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t 
know … a little, maybe … but we’ll see.’
‘Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party 
to-night; it’s only a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He 
could lie on the sofa. You are coming?’ Razumihin said to 
Zossimov. ‘Don’t forget, you promised.’
‘All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?’
‘Oh, nothing—tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie … 
just our friends.’
‘And who?’
‘All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my 
old uncle, and he is new too—he only arrived in Petersburg 
yesterday to see to some business of his. We meet once in 
five years.’
 195‘What is he?’
‘He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmas-
ter; gets a little pension. He is sixty-five—not worth talking 
about…. But I am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head 
of the Investigation Department here … But you know 
him.’
‘Is he a relation of yours, too?’
‘A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because 
you quarrelled once, won’t you come then?’
‘I don’t care a damn for him.’
‘So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a 
teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer and Za-
metov.’
‘Do tell me, please, what you or he’—Zossimov nodded at 
Raskolnikov— ‘can have in common with this Zametov?’
‘Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are 
worked by principles, as it were by springs; you won’t ven-
ture to turn round on your own account. If a man is a nice 
fellow, that’s the only principle I go upon. Zametov is a de-
lightful person.’
‘Though he does take bribes.’
‘Well, he does! and what of it? I don’t care if he does take 
bribes,’ Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. ‘I don’t 
praise him for taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in 
his own way! But if one looks at men in all ways—are there 
many good ones left? Why, I am sure I shouldn’t be worth a 
baked onion myself … perhaps with you thrown in.’
‘That’s too little; I’d give two for you.’
‘And I wouldn’t give more than one for you. No more 
 Crime and Punishment
196
of your jokes! Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull 
his hair and one must draw him not repel him. You’ll never 
improve a man by repelling him, especially a boy. One has 
to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive dull-
ards! You don’t understand. You harm yourselves running 
another man down…. But if you want to know, we really 
have something in common.’
‘I should like to know what.’
‘Why, it’s all about a house-painter…. We are getting 
him out of a mess! Though indeed there’s nothing to fear 
now. The matter is absolutely self-evident. We only put on 
steam.’
‘A painter?’
‘Why, haven’t I told you about it? I only told you the 
beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker-
woman. Well, the painter is mixed up in it …’
‘Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather in-
terested in it … partly … for one reason…. I read about it in 
the papers, too….’
‘Lizaveta was murdered, too,’ Nastasya blurted out, sud-
denly addressing Raskolnikov. She remained in the room 
all the time, standing by the door listening.
‘Lizaveta,’ murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
‘Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She 
used to come here. She mended a shirt for you, too.’
Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yel-
low paper he picked out one clumsy, white flower with 
brown lines on it and began examining how many petals 
there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how 
 197many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless as 
though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, 
but stared obstinately at the flower.
‘But what about the painter?’ Zossimov interrupted Nas-
tasya’s chatter with marked displeasure. She sighed and was 
silent.
‘Why, he was accused of the murder,’ Razumihin went 
on hotly.
‘Was there evidence against him then?’
‘Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and 
that’s what we have to prove. It was just as they pitched on 
those fellows, Koch and Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stu-
pidly it’s all done, it makes one sick, though it’s not one’s 
business! Pestryakov may be coming to-night…. By the 
way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already; it hap-
pened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the 
police office while they were talking about it.’
Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not 
stir.
‘But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody 
you are!’ Zossimov observed.
‘Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,’ shouted 
Razumihin, bringing his fist down on the table. ‘What’s the 
most offensive is not their lying—one can always forgive ly-
ing—lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth—what 
is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying…. I 
respect Porfiry, but … What threw them out at first? The 
door was locked, and when they came back with the porter 
it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were 
 Crime and Punishment
198
the murderers—that was their logic!’
‘But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, 
they could not help that…. And, by the way, I’ve met that 
man Koch. He used to buy unredeemed pledges from the 
old woman? Eh?’
‘Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He 
makes a profession of it. But enough of him! Do you know 
what makes me angry? It’s their sickening rotten, petrified 
routine…. And this case might be the means of introduc-
ing a new method. One can show from the psychological 
data alone how to get on the track of the real man. ‘We have 
facts,’ they say. But facts are not everything—at least half 
the business lies in how you interpret them!’
‘Can you interpret them, then?’
‘Anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feel-
ing, a tangible feeling, that one might be a help if only…. Eh! 
Do you know the details of the case?’
‘I am waiting to hear about the painter.’
‘Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after 
the murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pes-
tryakov—though they accounted for every step they took 
and it was as plain as a pikestaff- an unexpected fact turned 
up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop fac-
ing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s case 
containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. 
‘The day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’—mark the 
day and the hour!—‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, 
who had been in to see me already that day, brought me 
this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give 
 199him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got 
them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not 
ask him anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. 
‘I gave him a note’—a rouble that is—‘for I thought if he 
did not pawn it with me he would with another. It would 
all come to the same thing—he’d spend it on drink, so the 
thing had better be with me. The further you hide it the 
quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear 
any rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all 
taradiddle; he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, 
he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he 
did not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in or-
der to give it to the police. He was simply afraid. But no 
matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known this peas-
ant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the 
same province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan 
men. And though Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and 
I knew he had a job in that house, painting work with Dmi-
tri, who comes from the same village, too. As soon as he 
got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took 
his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him 
then. And the next day I heard that someone had murdered 
Alyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with 
an axe. I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the ear-
rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman lent money 
on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make care-
ful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all 
I asked, ‘Is Nikolay here?’ Dmitri told me that Nikolay had 
gone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, 
 Crime and Punishment
200
stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again. 
Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the job alone. 
And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the 
second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word 
to anyone’—that’s Dushkin’s tale—‘but I found out what I 
could about the murder, and went home feeling as suspi-
cious as ever. And at eight o’clock this morning’— that was 
the third day, you understand—‘I saw Nikolay coming in, 
not sober, though not to say very drunk—he could under-
stand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and 
did not speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a 
man I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. ‘Have you 
seen Dmitri?’ said I. ‘No, I haven’t,’ said he. ‘And you’ve not 
been here either?’ ‘Not since the day before yesterday,’ said 
he. ‘And where did you sleep last night?’ ‘In Peski, with the 
Kolomensky men.’ ‘And where did you get those ear-rings?’ 
I asked. ‘I found them in the street,’ and the way he said it 
was a bit queer; he did not look at me. ‘Did you hear what 
happened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same 
staircase?’ said I. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I had not heard,’ and all the 
while he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head 
and he turned as white as chalk. I told him all about it and 
he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted to keep him. 
‘Wait a bit, Nikolay,’ said I, ‘won’t you have a drink?’ And I 
signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from be-
hind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the 
turning at a run. I have not seen him since. Then my doubts 
were at an end—it was his doing, as clear as could be….’’
‘I should think so,’ said Zossimov.
 201‘Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low 
for Nikolay; they detained Dushkin and searched his house; 
Dmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were 
turned inside out. And the day before yesterday they ar-
rested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He had 
gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for 
a dram for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards 
the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the 
wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of 
his sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was 
trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman screeched 
her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’ 
‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll 
confess everything.’ Well, they took him to that police sta-
tion— that is here—with a suitable escort. So they asked 
him this and that, how old he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At 
the question, ‘When you were working with Dmitri, didn’t 
you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?’—
answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but 
I did not notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any 
noise, and so on?’ ‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you 
hear, Nikolay, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and 
her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I never knew a thing 
about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovitch 
the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the ear-
rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement. ‘Why didn’t you go 
to work with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drink-
ing.’ ‘And where were you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such 
a place.’ ‘Why did you run away from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because 
 Crime and Punishment
202
I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were you frightened of?’ 
‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be frightened, if 
you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not be-
lieve me, that question was put literally in those words. I 
know it for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do 
you say to that?’
‘Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.’
‘I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about 
that question, of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they 
squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed: ‘I did not 
find it in the street, but in the flat where I was painting with 
Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and I were paint-
ing there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and 
Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off
 
and I after him. I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and 
at the bottom of the stairs I ran right against the porter and 
some gentlemen—and how many gentlemen were there I 
don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other 
porter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore 
at us, too; and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, 
and he swore at us, too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the 
way. I got hold of Dmitri’s hair and knocked him down and 
began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught me by the hair 
and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper but 
in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and 
ran into the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch 
him, and went back to the flat alone; I had to clear up my 
things. I began putting them together, expecting Dmitri to 
come, and there in the passage, in the corner by the door, I 
 203stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper. 
I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them, and 
in the box were the ear-rings….’’
‘Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the 
door?’ Raskolnikov cried suddenly, staring with a blank 
look of terror at Razumihin, and he slowly sat up on the 
sofa, leaning on his hand.
‘Yes … why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?’ Razumi-
hin, too, got up from his seat.
‘Nothing,’ Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the 
wall. All were silent for a while.
‘He must have waked from a dream,’ Razumihin said 
at last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly 
shook his head.
‘Well, go on,’ said Zossimov. ‘What next?’
‘What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting 
Dmitri and everything, he took up his cap and ran to Du-
shkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him. He told a 
lie saying he found them in the street, and went off drink-
ing. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder: ‘I 
know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yes-
terday.’ ‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ 
‘I was frightened.’ ‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ 
‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’ ‘That I should be accused of 
it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now what do you sup-
pose they deduced from that?’
‘Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a 
fact. You wouldn’t have your painter set free?’
‘Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They 
 Crime and Punishment
204
haven’t a shadow of doubt.’
‘That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the 
ear-rings? You must admit that, if on the very same day 
and hour ear-rings from the old woman’s box have come 
into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there somehow. 
That’s a good deal in such a case.’
‘How did they get there? How did they get there?’ cried 
Razumihin. ‘How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to 
study man and who has more opportunity than anyone else 
for studying human nature—how can you fail to see the 
character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at 
once that the answers he has given in the examination are 
the holy truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has 
told us—he stepped on the box and picked it up.’
‘The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a 
lie at first?’
‘Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and 
Pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first 
porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter’s lodge 
and the man Kryukov, who had just got out of a cab at that 
minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm, that 
is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on 
the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri 
hung on to his hair, beating him, too. They lay right across 
the way, blocking the thoroughfare. They were sworn at on 
all sides while they ‘like children’ (the very words of the 
witnesses) were falling over one another, squealing, fight-
ing and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing one 
another like children, they ran into the street. Now take 
 205careful note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you under-
stand, warm when they found them! If they, or Nikolay 
alone, had murdered them and broken open the boxes, or 
simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one 
question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles 
and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, 
fiendish cunning, robbery? They’d just killed them, not five 
or ten minutes before, for the bodies were still warm, and at 
once, leaving the flat open, knowing that people would go 
there at once, flinging away their booty, they rolled about 
like children, laughing and attracting general attention. 
And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!’
‘Of course it is strange! It’s impossible, indeed, but …’
‘No, brother, no buts. And if the ear-rings being found 
in Nikolay’s hands at the very day and hour of the murder 
constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence 
against him—although the explanation given by him ac-
counts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously against 
him—one must take into consideration the facts which 
prove him innocent, especially as they are facts that cannot 
be denied. And do you suppose, from the character of our 
legal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a posi-
tion to accept, this fact— resting simply on a psychological 
impossibility—as irrefutable and conclusively breaking 
down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, 
they won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found 
the jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he 
could not have done if he hadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, 
that’s what excites me, you must understand!’
 Crime and Punishment
206
‘Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; 
what proof is there that the box came from the old wom-
an?’
‘That’s been proved,’ said Razumihin with apparent re-
luctance, frowning. ‘Koch recognised the jewel-case and 
gave the name of the owner, who proved conclusively that 
it was his.’
‘That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay 
at the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at 
first, and is there no evidence about that?’
‘Nobody did see him,’ Razumihin answered with vexa-
tion. ‘That’s the worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did 
not notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their 
evidence could not have been worth much. They said they 
saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going on 
in it, but they took no special notice and could not remem-
ber whether there actually were men at work in it.’
‘Hm! … So the only evidence for the defence is that they 
were beating one another and laughing. That constitutes a 
strong presumption, but … How do you explain the facts 
yourself?’
‘How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s 
clear. At any rate, the direction in which explanation is to 
be sought is clear, and the jewel-case points to it. The real 
murderer dropped those ear- rings. The murderer was up-
stairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked at the 
door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the mur-
derer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other 
way of escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the por-
 207ter in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of 
it. He stopped there while the porter and others were go-
ing upstairs, waited till they were out of hearing, and then 
went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri 
and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in 
the entry; possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are 
lots of people going in and out. He must have dropped the 
ear-rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door, 
and did not notice he dropped them, because he had other 
things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that 
he did stand there…. That’s how I explain it.’
‘Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats ev-
erything.’
‘But, why, why?’
‘Why, because everything fits too well … it’s too melo-
dramatic.’
‘A-ach!’ Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment 
the door opened and a personage came in who was a strang-
er to all present.

## Chapter 5

T
his was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and port-
ly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance. He 
began by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him 
with offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though 
asking himself what sort of place he had come to. Mistrust-
fully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost 
affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow ‘cabin.’ 
With the same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who 
lay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his miserable 
dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with the same de-
liberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and 
unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and 
inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat. A con-
strained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as 
might be expected, some scene-shifting took place. Reflect-
ing, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that 
he would get nothing in this ‘cabin’ by attempting to over-
awe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, 
though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of 
his question, addressed Zossimov:
‘Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or former-
ly a student?’
Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have an-
swered, had not Razumihin anticipated him.
 209‘Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?’
This familiar ‘what do you want’ seemed to cut the 
ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman. He was 
turning to Razumihin, but checked himself in time and 
turned to Zossimov again.
‘This is Raskolnikov,’ mumbled Zossimov, nodding to-
wards him. Then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his 
mouth as wide as possible. Then he lazily put his hand into 
his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a 
round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly 
and lazily proceeded to put it back.
Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, 
gazing persistently, though without understanding, at 
the stranger. Now that his face was turned away from the 
strange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore 
a look of anguish, as though he had just undergone an ago-
nising operation or just been taken from the rack. But the 
new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then 
his wonder, then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossi-
mov said ‘This is Raskolnikov’ he jumped up quickly, sat on 
the sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, 
voice articulated:
‘Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?’
The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressive-
ly:
‘Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope 
that my name is not wholly unknown to you?’
But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite dif-
ferent, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, 
 Crime and Punishment
210
as though he heard the name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the 
first time.
‘Is it possible that you can up to the present have received 
no information?’ asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat discon-
certed.
In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, 
put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A 
look of dismay came into Luzhin’s face. Zossimov and Ra-
zumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever, and at 
last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.
‘I had presumed and calculated,’ he faltered, ‘that a letter 
posted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago …’
‘I say, why are you standing in the doorway?’ Razumihin 
interrupted suddenly. ‘If you’ve something to say, sit down. 
Nastasya and you are so crowded. Nastasya, make room. 
Here’s a chair, thread your way in!’
He moved his chair back from the table, made a little 
space between the table and his knees, and waited in a rath-
er cramped position for the visitor to ‘thread his way in.’ 
The minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, 
and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and 
stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspi-
ciously at Razumihin.
‘No need to be nervous,’ the latter blurted out. ‘Rodya 
has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but 
now he is recovering and has got an appetite. This is his 
doctor, who has just had a look at him. I am a comrade of 
Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am nurs-
ing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with 
 211your business.’
‘Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my 
presence and conversation?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zos-
simov.
‘N-no,’ mumbled Zossimov; ‘you may amuse him.’ He 
yawned again.
‘He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,’ 
went on Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much 
like unaffected good- nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to 
be more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and 
impudent person had introduced himself as a student.
‘Your mamma,’ began Luzhin.
‘Hm!’ Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin 
looked at him inquiringly.
‘That’s all right, go on.’
Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.
‘Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I 
was sojourning in her neighbourhood. On my arrival here 
I purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to 
see you, in order that I might be fully assured that you were 
in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonish-
ment …’
‘I know, I know!’ Raskolnikov cried suddenly with im-
patient vexation. ‘So you are the fiancé? I know, and that’s 
enough!’
There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being of-
fended this time, but he said nothing. He made a violent 
effort to understand what it all meant. There was a mo-
ment’s silence.
 Crime and Punishment
212
Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards 
him when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again 
with marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look 
at him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he 
rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him. There cer-
tainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole 
appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of 
‘fiancé’ so unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, 
it was evident, far too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petro-
vitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to 
get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his be-
trothed—a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, 
indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, conscious-
ness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might 
have been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr 
Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé. All his clothes 
were fresh from the tailor’s and were all right, except for be-
ing too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even the stylish 
new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch 
treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his 
hands. The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, 
told the same tale, if only from the fact of his not wearing 
them, but carrying them in his hand for show. Light and 
youthful colours predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch’s attire. 
He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light 
thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a 
cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and 
the best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very 
fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his for-
 213ty-five years at all times. His dark, mutton-chop whiskers 
made an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly 
upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair, touched 
here and there with grey, though it had been combed and 
curled at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appear-
ance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting 
a German on his wedding-day. If there really was some-
thing unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking 
and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes. 
After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov 
smiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at 
the ceiling as before.
But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to deter-
mine to take no notice of their oddities.
‘I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,’ 
he began, again breaking the silence with an effort. ‘If I had 
been aware of your illness I should have come earlier. But 
you know what business is. I have, too, a very important 
legal affair in the Senate, not to mention other preoccupa-
tions which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your 
mamma and sister any minute.’
Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to 
speak; his face showed some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch 
paused, waited, but as nothing followed, he went on:
‘… Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their 
arrival.’
‘Where?’ asked Raskolnikov weakly.
‘Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.’
‘That’s in Voskresensky,’ put in Razumihin. ‘There are 
 Crime and Punishment
214
two storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve 
been there.’
‘Yes, rooms …’
‘A disgusting place—filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of 
doubtful character. Things have happened there, and there 
are all sorts of queer people living there. And I went there 
about a scandalous business. It’s cheap, though …’
‘I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am 
a stranger in Petersburg myself,’ Pyotr Petrovitch replied 
huffily. ‘However, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, 
and as it is for so short a time … I have already taken a 
permanent, that is, our future flat,’ he said, addressing Ras-
kolnikov, ‘and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I 
am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend 
Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame 
Lippevechsel; it was he who told me of Bakaleyev’s house, 
too …’
‘Lebeziatnikov?’ said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling 
something.
‘Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the 
Ministry. Do you know him?’
‘Yes … no,’ Raskolnikov answered.
‘Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his 
guardian…. A very nice young man and advanced. I like to 
meet young people: one learns new things from them.’ Lu-
zhin looked round hopefully at them all.
‘How do you mean?’ asked Razumihin.
‘In the most serious and essential matters,’ Pyotr Petro-
vitch replied, as though delighted at the question. ‘You see, 
 215it’s ten years since I visited Petersburg. All the novelties, re-
forms, ideas have reached us in the provinces, but to see 
it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg. And it’s my 
notion that you observe and learn most by watching the 
younger generation. And I confess I am delighted …’
‘At what?’
‘Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I 
fancy I find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more 
practicality …’
‘That’s true,’ Zossimov let drop.
‘Nonsense! There’s no practicality.’ Razumihin flew at 
him. ‘Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop 
down from heaven. And for the last two hundred years we 
have been divorced from all practical life. Ideas, if you like, 
are fermenting,’ he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, ‘and desire for 
good exists, though it’s in a childish form, and honesty you 
may find, although there are crowds of brigands. Anyway, 
there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.’
‘I don’t agree with you,’ Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with ev-
ident enjoyment. ‘Of course, people do get carried away and 
make mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mis-
takes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and 
of abnormal external environment. If little has been done, 
the time has been but short; of means I will not speak. It’s 
my personal view, if you care to know, that something has 
been accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valu-
able works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy 
and romantic authors. Literature is taking a maturer form, 
many injurious prejudice have been rooted up and turned 
 Crime and Punishment
216
into ridicule…. In a word, we have cut ourselves off irre-
vocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great 
thing …’
‘He’s learnt it by heart to show off!’ Raskolnikov pro-
nounced suddenly.
‘What?’ asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; 
but he received no reply.
‘That’s all true,’ Zossimov hastened to interpose.
‘Isn’t it so?’ Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at 
Zossimov. ‘You must admit,’ he went on, addressing Razu-
mihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness—he 
almost added ‘young man’—‘that there is an advance, or, as 
they say now, progress in the name of science and economic 
truth …’
‘A commonplace.’
‘No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were 
told, ‘love thy neighbour,’ what came of it?’ Pyotr Petrovitch 
went on, perhaps with excessive haste. ‘It came to my tear-
ing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both 
were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has it, ‘Catch sev-
eral hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells us, 
love yourself before all men, for everything in the world 
rests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your 
own affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Econom-
ic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in 
society—the more whole coats, so to say—the firmer are its 
foundations and the better is the common welfare organised 
too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for 
myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to 
 217bring to pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a 
torn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but 
as a consequence of the general advance. The idea is simple, 
but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being 
hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it would 
seem to want very little wit to perceive it …’
‘Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,’ Razumihin cut in 
sharply, ‘and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with 
an object, but I’ve grown so sick during the last three years 
of this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow 
of commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I blush 
even when other people talk like that. You are in a hurry, no 
doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you, 
that’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort 
of man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got 
hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in 
their own interests everything they touched, that the whole 
cause has been dragged in the mire. That’s enough!’
‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking 
with excessive dignity. ‘Do you mean to suggest so uncer-
emoniously that I too …’
‘Oh, my dear sir … how could I? … Come, that’s enough,’ 
Razumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov 
to continue their previous conversation.
Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the dis-
avowal. He made up his mind to take leave in another 
minute or two.
‘I trust our acquaintance,’ he said, addressing Raskolnikov, 
‘may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances 
 Crime and Punishment
218
of which you are aware, become closer … Above all, I hope 
for your return to health …’
Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petro-
vitch began getting up from his chair.
‘One of her customers must have killed her,’ Zossimov 
declared positively.
‘Not a doubt of it,’ replied Razumihin. ‘Porfiry doesn’t 
give his opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges 
with her there.’
‘Examining them?’ Raskolnikov asked aloud.
‘Yes. What then?’
‘Nothing.’
‘How does he get hold of them?’ asked Zossimov.
‘Koch has given the names of some of them, other names 
are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come for-
ward of themselves.’
‘It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The 
boldness of it! The coolness!’
‘That’s just what it wasn’t!’ interposed Razumihin. ‘That’s 
what throws you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is 
not cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first 
crime! The supposition that it was a calculated crime and a 
cunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose him to have been 
inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance that 
saved him—and chance may do anything. Why, he did not 
foresee obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He 
took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets 
with them, ransacked the old woman’s trunks, her rags—
and they found fifteen hundred roubles, besides notes, in 
 219a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know how 
to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure 
you, his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by 
luck than good counsel!’
‘You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I 
believe?’ Pyotr Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He 
was standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing 
he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases. 
He was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression 
and his vanity overcame his prudence.
‘Yes. You’ve heard of it?’
‘Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.’
‘Do you know the details?’
‘I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me 
in the case— the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of 
the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among 
the lower classes during the last five years, not to speak of 
the cases of robbery and arson everywhere, what strikes 
me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, 
crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears 
of a student’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another 
place people of good social position forge false banknotes; 
in Moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used 
to forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders was a lec-
turer in universal history; then our secretary abroad was 
murdered from some obscure motive of gain…. And if this 
old woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by some-
one of a higher class in society—for peasants don’t pawn 
gold trinkets— how are we to explain this demoralisation 
 Crime and Punishment
220
of the civilised part of our society?’
‘There are many economic changes,’ put in Zossimov.
‘How are we to explain it?’ Razumihin caught him up. ‘It 
might be explained by our inveterate impracticality.’
‘How do you mean?’
‘What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to 
the question why he was forging notes? ‘Everybody is get-
ting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to 
get rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words, but the up-
shot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting 
or working! We’ve grown used to having everything ready-
made, to walking on crutches, to having our food chewed 
for us. Then the great hour struck,[*] and every man showed 
himself in his true colours.’
[*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.—
TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.
‘But morality? And so to speak, principles …’
‘But why do you worry about it?’ Raskolnikov interposed 
suddenly. ‘It’s in accordance with your theory!’
‘In accordance with my theory?’
‘Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating 
just now, and it follows that people may be killed …’
‘Upon my word!’ cried Luzhin.
‘No, that’s not so,’ put in Zossimov.
Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper 
lip, breathing painfully.
‘There’s a measure in all things,’ Luzhin went on super-
ciliously. ‘Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, 
and one has but to suppose …’
 221‘And is it true,’ Raskolnikov interposed once more sud-
denly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in 
insulting him, ‘is it true that you told your fiancée … within 
an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you most … 
was that she was a beggar … because it was better to raise 
a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control 
over her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?’
‘Upon my word,’ Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, 
crimson with confusion, ‘to distort my words in this way! 
Excuse me, allow me to assure you that the report which 
has reached you, or rather, let me say, has been conveyed 
to you, has no foundation in truth, and I … suspect who … 
in a word … this arrow … in a word, your mamma … She 
seemed to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, 
of a somewhat high-flown and romantic way of thinking…. 
But I was a thousand miles from supposing that she would 
misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a 
way…. And indeed … indeed …’
‘I tell you what,’ cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his 
pillow and fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, ‘I 
tell you what.’
‘What?’ Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and of-
fended face. Silence lasted for some seconds.
‘Why, if ever again … you dare to mention a single word 
… about my mother … I shall send you flying downstairs!’
‘What’s the matter with you?’ cried Razumihin.
‘So that’s how it is?’ Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. 
‘Let me tell you, sir,’ he began deliberately, doing his utmost 
to restrain himself but breathing hard, ‘at the first moment 
 Crime and Punishment
222
I saw you you were ill-disposed to me, but I remained here 
on purpose to find out more. I could forgive a great deal in a 
sick man and a connection, but you … never after this …’
‘I am not ill,’ cried Raskolnikov.
‘So much the worse …’
‘Go to hell!’
But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his 
speech, squeezing between the table and the chair; Razu-
mihin got up this time to let him pass. Without glancing 
at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who had for 
some time been making signs to him to let the sick man 
alone, he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoul-
ders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. 
And even the curve of his spine was expressive of the hor-
rible insult he had received.
‘How could you—how could you!’ Razumihin said, shak-
ing his head in perplexity.
‘Let me alone—let me alone all of you!’ Raskolnikov cried 
in a frenzy. ‘Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not 
afraid of you! I am not afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get 
away from me! I want to be alone, alone, alone!’
‘Come along,’ said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.
‘But we can’t leave him like this!’
‘Come along,’ Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went 
out. Razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him.
‘It might be worse not to obey him,’ said Zossimov on the 
stairs. ‘He mustn’t be irritated.’
‘What’s the matter with him?’
‘If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what 
 223would do it! At first he was better…. You know he has got 
something on his mind! Some fixed idea weighing on him…. 
I am very much afraid so; he must have!’
‘Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his 
conversation I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that 
he had received a letter about it just before his illness….’
‘Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case al-
together. But have you noticed, he takes no interest in 
anything, he does not respond to anything except one point 
on which he seems excited—that’s the murder?’
‘Yes, yes,’ Razumihin agreed, ‘I noticed that, too. He is 
interested, frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was 
ill in the police office; he fainted.’
‘Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you 
something afterwards. He interests me very much! In half 
an hour I’ll go and see him again…. There’ll be no inflam-
mation though.’
‘Thanks! And I’ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will 
keep watch on him through Nastasya….’
Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and mis-
ery at Nastasya, but she still lingered.
‘Won’t you have some tea now?’ she asked.
‘Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.’
He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.

B
ut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, 
undid the parcel which Razumihin had brought in that 
evening and had tied up again and began dressing. Strange 
to say, he seemed immediately to have become perfectly 
calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic 
fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment 
of a strange sudden calm. His movements were precise and 
definite; a firm purpose was evident in them. ‘To-day, to-
day,’ he muttered to himself. He understood that he was 
still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him 
strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he 
would not fall down in the street. When he had dressed in 
entirely new clothes, he looked at the money lying on the ta-
ble, and after a moment’s thought put it in his pocket. It was 
twenty-five roubles. He took also all the copper change from 
the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes. Then he 
softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and 
glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing 
with her back to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. 
She heard nothing. Who would have dreamed of his going 
out, indeed? A minute later he was in the street.
It was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as 
stifling as before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty 
town air. His head felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy 
 225gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted, pale 
and yellow face. He did not know and did not think where 
he was going, he had one thought only: ‘that all this must be 
ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would not 
return home without it, because he would not go on living 
like that. ’ How, with what to make an end? He had not an 
idea about it, he did not even want to think of it. He drove 
away thought; thought tortured him. All he knew, all he felt 
was that everything must be changed ‘one way or another,’ 
he repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence 
and determination.
From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction 
of the Hay Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel 
organ was standing in the road in front of a little general 
shop and was grinding out a very sentimental song. He was 
accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the pavement 
in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a man-
tle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all 
very old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, 
cracked and coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope 
of getting a copper from the shop. Raskolnikov joined two 
or three listeners, took out a five copeck piece and put it in 
the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a sentimental high 
note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder ‘Come on,’ and 
both moved on to the next shop.
‘Do you like street music?’ said Raskolnikov, addressing 
a middle-aged man standing idly by him. The man looked 
at him, startled and wondering.
‘I love to hear singing to a street organ,’ said Raskolnikov, 
 Crime and Punishment
226
and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the 
subject—‘I like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings—
they must be damp—when all the passers-by have pale 
green, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling 
straight down, when there’s no wind—you know what I 
mean?—and the street lamps shine through it …’
‘I don’t know…. Excuse me …’ muttered the stranger, 
frightened by the question and Raskolnikov’s strange man-
ner, and he crossed over to the other side of the street.
Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the cor-
ner of the Hay Market, where the huckster and his wife had 
talked with Lizaveta; but they were not there now. Recog-
nising the place, he stopped, looked round and addressed a 
young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn 
chandler’s shop.
‘Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this 
corner?’
‘All sorts of people keep booths here,’ answered the young 
man, glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov.
‘What’s his name?’
‘What he was christened.’
‘Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?’
The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.
‘It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Gra-
ciously forgive me, your excellency!’
‘Is that a tavern at the top there?’
‘Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and 
you’ll find princesses there too…. La-la!’
Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was 
 227a dense crowd of peasants. He pushed his way into the thick-
est part of it, looking at the faces. He felt an unaccountable 
inclination to enter into conversation with people. But the 
peasants took no notice of him; they were all shouting in 
groups together. He stood and thought a little and took a 
turning to the right in the direction of V.
He had often crossed that little street which turns at an 
angle, leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of 
late he had often felt drawn to wander about this district, 
when he felt depressed, that he might feel more so.
Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point 
there is a great block of buildings, entirely let out in dram 
shops and eating- houses; women were continually running 
in and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes. Here 
and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, espe-
cially about the entrances to various festive establishments 
in the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds 
of singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, 
floated into the street. A crowd of women were throng-
ing round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others 
on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunk-
en soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in 
the road, swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way 
somewhere, but had forgotten where. One beggar was quar-
relling with another, and a man dead drunk was lying right 
across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of women, 
who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed 
and wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were 
women of forty and some not more than seventeen; almost 
 Crime and Punishment
228
all had blackened eyes.
He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise 
and uproar in the saloon below…. someone could be heard 
within dancing frantically, marking time with his heels to 
the sounds of the guitar and of a thin falsetto voice sing-
ing a jaunty air. He listened intently, gloomily and dreamily, 
bending down at the entrance and peeping inquisitively in 
from the pavement.
‘Oh, my handsome soldier Don’t beat me for nothing,’
trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a 
great desire to make out what he was singing, as though ev-
erything depended on that.
‘Shall I go in?’ he thought. ‘They are laughing. From 
drink. Shall I get drunk?’
‘Won’t you come in?’ one of the women asked him. Her 
voice was still musical and less thick than the others, she 
was young and not repulsive—the only one of the group.
‘Why, she’s pretty,’ he said, drawing himself up and look-
ing at her.
She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.
‘You’re very nice looking yourself,’ she said.
‘Isn’t he thin though!’ observed another woman in a deep 
bass. ‘Have you just come out of a hospital?’
‘They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have 
all snub noses,’ interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile 
on his face, wearing a loose coat. ‘See how jolly they are.’
‘Go along with you!’
‘I’ll go, sweetie!’
And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov 
 229moved on.
‘I say, sir,’ the girl shouted after him.
‘What is it?’
She hesitated.
‘I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind 
gentleman, but now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a 
drink, there’s a nice young man!’
Raskolnikov gave her what came first—fifteen copecks.
‘Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!’
‘What’s your name?’
‘Ask for Duclida.’
‘Well, that’s too much,’ one of the women observed, shak-
ing her head at Duclida. ‘I don’t know how you can ask like 
that. I believe I should drop with shame….’
Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a 
pock-marked wench of thirty, covered with bruises, with 
her upper lip swollen. She made her criticism quietly and 
earnestly. ‘Where is it,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Where is it 
I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, 
an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high 
rock, on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, 
and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, 
everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain stand-
ing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, 
eternity, it were better to live so than to die at once! Only to 
live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be! … How true it 
is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature! … And vile 
is he who calls him vile for that,’ he added a moment later.
He went into another street. ‘Bah, the Palais de Cristal! 
 Crime and Punishment
230
Razumihin was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But 
what on earth was it I wanted? Yes, the newspapers…. Zos-
simov said he’d read it in the papers. Have you the papers?’ 
he asked, going into a very spacious and positively clean 
restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were, how-
ever, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, 
and in a room further away were sitting four men drinking 
champagne. Raskolnikov fancied that Zametov was one of 
them, but he could not be sure at that distance. ‘What if it 
is?’ he thought.
‘Will you have vodka?’ asked the waiter.
‘Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones 
for the last five days, and I’ll give you something.’
‘Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?’
The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskol-
nikov sat down and began to look through them.
‘Oh, damn … these are the items of intelligence. An 
accident on a staircase, spontaneous combustion of a 
shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire in Peski … a fire in the Pe-
tersburg quarter … another fire in the Petersburg quarter … 
and another fire in the Petersburg quarter…. Ah, here it is!’ 
He found at last what he was seeking and began to read it. 
The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began 
eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. 
His hands shook with nervous impatience as he turned the 
sheets. Suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table. 
He looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just 
the same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, 
with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the 
 231smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He 
was in a good humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and 
good-humouredly. His dark face was rather flushed from 
the champagne he had drunk.
‘What, you here?’ he began in surprise, speaking as 
though he’d known him all his life. ‘Why, Razumihin told 
me only yesterday you were unconscious. How strange! 
And do you know I’ve been to see you?’
Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid 
aside the papers and turned to Zametov. There was a smile 
on his lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was ap-
parent in that smile.
‘I know you have,’ he answered. ‘I’ve heard it. You looked 
for my sock…. And you know Razumihin has lost his heart 
to you? He says you’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s—
you know, the woman you tried to befriend, for whom 
you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he would not 
understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to un-
derstand—it was quite clear, wasn’t it?’
‘What a hot head he is!’
‘The explosive one?’
‘No, your friend Razumihin.’
‘You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to 
the most agreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne 
into you just now?’
‘We’ve just been … having a drink together…. You talk 
about pouring it into me!’
‘By way of a fee! You profit by everything!’ Raskolnikov 
laughed, ‘it’s all right, my dear boy,’ he added, slapping Za-
 Crime and Punishment
232
metov on the shoulder. ‘I am not speaking from temper, but 
in a friendly way, for sport, as that workman of yours said 
when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of the old 
woman….’
‘How do you know about it?’
‘Perhaps I know more about it than you do.’
‘How strange you are…. I am sure you are still very un-
well. You oughtn’t to have come out.’
‘Oh, do I seem strange to you?’
‘Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?’
‘Yes.’
‘There’s a lot about the fires.’
‘No, I am not reading about the fires.’ Here he looked 
mysteriously at Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a 
mocking smile. ‘No, I am not reading about the fires,’ he 
went on, winking at Zametov. ‘But confess now, my dear 
fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading 
about?’
‘I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do 
you keep on … ?’
‘Listen, you are a man of culture and education?’
‘I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,’ said Zametov 
with some dignity.
‘Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting 
and your rings— you are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what 
a charming boy!’ Here Raskolnikov broke into a nervous 
laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew back, more 
amazed than offended.
‘Foo! how strange you are!’ Zametov repeated very seri-
 233ously. ‘I can’t help thinking you are still delirious.’
‘I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I 
am strange? You find me curious, do you?’
‘Yes, curious.’
‘Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was 
looking for? See what a lot of papers I’ve made them bring 
me. Suspicious, eh?’
‘Well, what is it?’
‘You prick up your ears?’
‘How do you mean—‘prick up my ears’?’
‘I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to 
you … no, better ‘I confess’ … No, that’s not right either; ‘I 
make a deposition and you take it.’ I depose that I was read-
ing, that I was looking and searching….’ he screwed up his 
eyes and paused. ‘I was searching—and came here on pur-
pose to do it—for news of the murder of the old pawnbroker 
woman,’ he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing 
his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov 
looked at him steadily, without moving or drawing his face 
away. What struck Zametov afterwards as the strangest part 
of it all was that silence followed for exactly a minute, and 
that they gazed at one another all the while.
‘What if you have been reading about it?’ he cried at last, 
perplexed and impatient. ‘That’s no business of mine! What 
of it?’
‘The same old woman,’ Raskolnikov went on in the same 
whisper, not heeding Zametov’s explanation, ‘about whom 
you were talking in the police-office, you remember, when I 
fainted. Well, do you understand now?’
 Crime and Punishment
234
‘What do you mean? Understand … what?’ Zametov 
brought out, almost alarmed.
Raskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly trans-
formed, and he suddenly went off into the same nervous 
laugh as before, as though utterly unable to restrain himself. 
And in one flash he recalled with extraordinary vividness of 
sensation a moment in the recent past, that moment when 
he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch trem-
bled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a 
sudden desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out 
his tongue at them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and 
laugh!
‘You are either mad, or …’ began Zametov, and he broke 
off, as though stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed 
into his mind.
‘Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!’
‘Nothing,’ said Zametov, getting angry, ‘it’s all non-
sense!’
Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskol-
nikov became suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put 
his elbow on the table and leaned his head on his hand. He 
seemed to have completely forgotten Zametov. The silence 
lasted for some time.
‘Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,’ said Za-
metov.
‘What! Tea? Oh, yes….’ Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put 
a morsel of bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Za-
metov, seemed to remember everything and pulled himself 
together. At the same moment his face resumed its original 
 235mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.
‘There have been a great many of these crimes lately,’ said 
Zametov. ‘Only the other day I read in the Moscow News 
that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in Mos-
cow. It was a regular society. They used to forge tickets!’
‘Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month 
ago,’ Raskolnikov answered calmly. ‘So you consider them 
criminals?’ he added, smiling.
‘Of course they are criminals.’
‘They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, 
half a hundred people meeting for such an object—what an 
idea! Three would be too many, and then they want to have 
more faith in one another than in themselves! One has only 
to blab in his cups and it all collapses. Simpletons! They en-
gaged untrustworthy people to change the notes— what a 
thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that 
these simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and 
what follows for the rest of their lives? Each is dependent 
on the others for the rest of his life! Better hang oneself at 
once! And they did not know how to change the notes ei-
ther; the man who changed the notes took five thousand 
roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four 
thousand, but did not count the fifth thousand—he was in 
such a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away. 
Of course he roused suspicion. And the whole thing came 
to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?’
‘That his hands trembled?’ observed Zametov, ‘yes, that’s 
quite possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes 
one can’t stand things.’
 Crime and Punishment
236
‘Can’t stand that?’
‘Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the 
sake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience? 
To go with false notes into a bank where it’s their business 
to spot that sort of thing! No, I should not have the face to 
do it. Would you?’
Raskolnikov had an intense desire again ‘to put his 
tongue out.’ Shivers kept running down his spine.
‘I should do it quite differently,’ Raskolnikov began. ‘This 
is how I would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand 
three or four times backwards and forwards, looking at ev-
ery note and then I’d set to the second thousand; I’d count 
that half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note 
to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again—to 
see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, 
‘a relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day 
through a false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole sto-
ry. And after I began counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I 
would say, ‘I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred 
in that second thousand, I am not sure.’ And so I would give 
up the third thousand and go back to the second and so on 
to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from 
the fifth and one from the second thousand and take them 
again to the light and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and 
put the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how 
to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had gone out, I’d 
come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation. 
That’s how I’d do it.’
‘Foo! what terrible things you say!’ said Zametov, laugh-
 237ing. ‘But all that is only talk. I dare say when it came to 
deeds you’d make a slip. I believe that even a practised, des-
perate man cannot always reckon on himself, much less 
you and I. To take an example near home—that old woman 
murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been 
a desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, 
was saved by a miracle—but his hands shook, too. He did 
not succeed in robbing the place, he couldn’t stand it. That 
was clear from the …’
Raskolnikov seemed offended.
‘Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?’ he cried, mali-
ciously gibing at Zametov.
‘Well, they will catch him.’
‘Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve 
a tough job! A great point for you is whether a man is spend-
ing money or not. If he had no money and suddenly begins 
spending, he must be the man. So that any child can mis-
lead you.’
‘The fact is they always do that, though,’ answered Zame-
tov. ‘A man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his 
life and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern. They are 
caught spending money, they are not all as cunning as you 
are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?’
Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.
‘You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know 
how I should behave in that case, too?’ he asked with dis-
pleasure.
‘I should like to,’ Zametov answered firmly and serious-
ly. Somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his 
 Crime and Punishment
238
words and looks.
‘Very much?’
‘Very much!’
‘All right then. This is how I should behave,’ Raskolnikov 
began, again bringing his face close to Zametov’s, again 
staring at him and speaking in a whisper, so that the lat-
ter positively shuddered. ‘This is what I should have done. 
I should have taken the money and jewels, I should have 
walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted 
place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, 
some kitchen garden or place of that sort. I should have 
looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundred-
weight or more which had been lying in the corner from 
the time the house was built. I would lift that stone—there 
would sure to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jew-
els and money in that hole. Then I’d roll the stone back so 
that it would look as before, would press it down with my 
foot and walk away. And for a year or two, three maybe, I 
would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d 
be no trace.’
‘You are a madman,’ said Zametov, and for some reason 
he too spoke in a whisper, and moved away from Raskol-
nikov, whose eyes were glittering. He had turned fearfully 
pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering. He bent 
down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to 
move without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; 
he knew what he was doing, but could not restrain himself. 
The terrible word trembled on his lips, like the latch on that 
door; in another moment it will break out, in another mo-
 239ment he will let it go, he will speak out.
‘And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and 
Lizaveta?’ he said suddenly and—realised what he had 
done.
Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the 
tablecloth. His face wore a contorted smile.
‘But is it possible?’ he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov 
looked wrathfully at him.
‘Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?’
‘Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,’ Zametov 
cried hastily.
‘I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it be-
fore, if now you believe less than ever?’
‘Not at all,’ cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. ‘Have 
you been frightening me so as to lead up to this?’
‘You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about 
behind my back when I went out of the police-office? And 
why did the explosive lieutenant question me after I fainted? 
Hey, there,’ he shouted to the waiter, getting up and taking 
his cap, ‘how much?’
‘Thirty copecks,’ the latter replied, running up.
‘And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot 
of money!’ he held out his shaking hand to Zametov with 
notes in it. ‘Red notes and blue, twenty-five roubles. Where 
did I get them? And where did my new clothes come from? 
You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my 
landlady, I’ll be bound…. Well, that’s enough! Assez causé! 
Till we meet again!’
He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild 
 Crime and Punishment
240
hysterical sensation, in which there was an element of in-
sufferable rapture. Yet he was gloomy and terribly tired. His 
face was twisted as after a fit. His fatigue increased rapidly. 
Any shock, any irritating sensation stimulated and revived 
his energies at once, but his strength failed as quickly when 
the stimulus was removed.
Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, 
plunged in thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a 
revolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up 
his mind for him conclusively.
‘Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,’ he decided.
Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restau-
rant when he stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. 
They did not see each other till they almost knocked against 
each other. For a moment they stood looking each other up 
and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then anger, 
real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.
‘So here you are!’ he shouted at the top of his voice—‘you 
ran away from your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you 
under the sofa! We went up to the garret. I almost beat Nas-
tasya on your account. And here he is after all. Rodya! What 
is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole truth! Confess! Do 
you hear?’
‘It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be 
alone,’ Raskolnikov answered calmly.
‘Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face 
is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot! 
… What have you been doing in the Palais de Cristal? Own 
up at once!’
 241‘Let me go!’ said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This 
was too much for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the 
shoulder.
‘Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know 
what I’ll do with you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in 
a bundle, carry you home under my arm and lock you up!’
‘Listen, Razumihin,’ Raskolnikov began quietly, ap-
parently calm— ‘can’t you see that I don’t want your 
benevolence? A strange desire you have to shower benefits 
on a man who … curses them, who feels them a burden 
in fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my 
illness? Maybe I was very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plain-
ly enough to-day that you were torturing me, that I was … 
sick of you! You seem to want to torture people! I assure 
you that all that is seriously hindering my recovery, because 
it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov went away 
just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for 
goodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me 
by force? Don’t you see that I am in possession of all my 
faculties now? How, how can I persuade you not to perse-
cute me with your kindness? I may be ungrateful, I may be 
mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be! Let me be, 
let me be!’
He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venom-
ous phrases he was about to utter, but finished, panting for 
breath, in a frenzy, as he had been with Luzhin.
Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand 
drop.
‘Well, go to hell then,’ he said gently and thoughtfully. 
 Crime and Punishment
242
‘Stay,’ he roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. ‘Listen 
to me. Let me tell you, that you are all a set of babbling, pos-
ing idiots! If you’ve any little trouble you brood over it like a 
hen over an egg. And you are plagiarists even in that! There 
isn’t a sign of independent life in you! You are made of sper-
maceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins instead of 
blood. I don’t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstanc-
es the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! 
Stop!’ he cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskol-
nikov was again making a movement—‘hear me out! You 
know I’m having a house-warming this evening, I dare say 
they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there—I just ran 
in—to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a com-
mon fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of 
a translation … you see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever 
fellow, but you’re a fool!—and if you weren’t a fool you’d 
come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your 
boots in the street! Since you have gone out, there’s no help 
for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one … 
a cup of tea, company…. Or you could lie on the sofa—any 
way you would be with us…. Zossimov will be there too. 
Will you come?’
‘No.’
‘R-rubbish!’ Razumihin shouted, out of patience. ‘How 
do you know? You can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know 
anything about it…. Thousands of times I’ve fought tooth 
and nail with people and run back to them afterwards…. 
One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So remember, 
Potchinkov’s house on the third storey….’
 243‘Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you’d let anybody 
beat you from sheer benevolence.’
‘Beat? Whom? Me? I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea! 
Potchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat….’
‘I shall not come, Razumihin.’ Raskolnikov turned and 
walked away.
‘I bet you will,’ Razumihin shouted after him. ‘I refuse to 
know you if you don’t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?’
‘Yes.’
‘Did you see him?’
‘Yes.’
‘Talked to him?’
‘Yes.’
‘What about? Confound you, don’t tell me then. 
Potchinkov’s house, 47, Babushkin’s flat, remember!’
Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sa-
dovy Street. Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. 
Then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but 
stopped short of the stairs.
‘Confound it,’ he went on almost aloud. ‘He talked sensi-
bly but yet … I am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! 
And this was just what Zossimov seemed afraid of.’ He 
struck his finger on his forehead. ‘What if … how could I 
let him go off alone? He may drown himself…. Ach, what a 
blunder! I can’t.’ And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, 
but there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned 
with rapid steps to the Palais de Cristal to question Zame-
tov.
Raskolnikov walked straight to X—— Bridge, stood in 
 Crime and Punishment

the middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into 
the distance. On parting with Razumihin, he felt so much 
weaker that he could scarcely reach this place. He longed to 
sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending over the 
water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the 
sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering 
twilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flash-
ing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at 
the darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to 
catch his attention. At last red circles flashed before his eyes, 
the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, 
the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he start-
ed, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and 
hideous sight. He became aware of someone standing on 
the right side of him; he looked and saw a tall woman with 
a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and 
red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but obvi-
ously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she 
leaned her right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg 
over the railing, then her left and threw herself into the ca-
nal. The filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for 
a moment, but an instant later the drowning woman float-
ed to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head 
and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over 
her back.
‘A woman drowning! A woman drowning!’ shouted doz-
ens of voices; people ran up, both banks were thronged 
with spectators, on the bridge people crowded about Ras-
kolnikov, pressing up behind him.
 245‘Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!’ a woman cried tearfully 
close by. ‘Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!’
‘A boat, a boat’ was shouted in the crowd. But there was 
no need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the ca-
nal, threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into 
the water. It was easy to reach her: she floated within a cou-
ple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of her clothes 
with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a 
comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled 
out at once. They laid her on the granite pavement of the 
embankment. She soon recovered consciousness, raised 
her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly 
wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.
‘She’s drunk herself out of her senses,’ the same woman’s 
voice wailed at her side. ‘Out of her senses. The other day 
she tried to hang herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the 
shop just now, left my little girl to look after her—and here 
she’s in trouble again! A neighbour, gentleman, a neighbour, 
we live close by, the second house from the end, see yon-
der….’
The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the 
woman, someone mentioned the police station…. Raskol-
nikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and 
apathy. He felt disgusted. ‘No, that’s loathsome … water … 
it’s not good enough,’ he muttered to himself. ‘Nothing will 
come of it,’ he added, ‘no use to wait. What about the police 
office … ? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The 
police office is open till ten o’clock….’ He turned his back to 
the railing and looked about him.
 Crime and Punishment
246
‘Very well then!’ he said resolutely; he moved from the 
bridge and walked in the direction of the police office. His 
heart felt hollow and empty. He did not want to think. Even 
his depression had passed, there was not a trace now of the 
energy with which he had set out ‘to make an end of it all.’ 
Complete apathy had succeeded to it.
‘Well, it’s a way out of it,’ he thought, walking slowly and 
listlessly along the canal bank. ‘Anyway I’ll make an end, 
for I want to…. But is it a way out? What does it matter! 
There’ll be the square yard of space—ha! But what an end! 
Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or not? Ah … damn! 
How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down 
soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But 
I don’t care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into 
one’s head.’
To reach the police office he had to go straight forward 
and take the second turning to the left. It was only a few 
paces away. But at the first turning he stopped and, after 
a minute’s thought, turned into a side street and went two 
streets out of his way, possibly without any object, or pos-
sibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking 
at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in 
his ear; he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at 
the very gate of the house. He had not passed it, he had not 
been near it since that evening. An overwhelming, unac-
countable prompting drew him on. He went into the house, 
passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on 
the right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the 
fourth storey. The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He 
 247stopped at each landing and looked round him with curios-
ity; on the first landing the framework of the window had 
been taken out. ‘That wasn’t so then,’ he thought. Here was 
the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had 
been working. ‘It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So 
it’s to let.’ Then the third storey and the fourth. ‘Here!’ He 
was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open. There 
were men there, he could hear voices; he had not expected 
that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and 
went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were 
workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow 
fancied that he would find everything as he left it, even per-
haps the corpses in the same places on the floor. And now, 
bare walls, no furniture; it seemed strange. He walked to 
the window and sat down on the window-sill. There were 
two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger 
than the other. They were papering the walls with a new 
white paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, 
dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly 
annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper with dislike, as 
though he felt sorry to have it all so changed. The workmen 
had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were 
hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go 
home. They took no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they 
were talking. Raskolnikov folded his arms and listened.
‘She comes to me in the morning,’ said the elder to the 
younger, ‘very early, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preen-
ing and prinking?’ says I. ‘I am ready to do anything to 
please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of going on! And she 
 Crime and Punishment
248
dressed up like a regular fashion book!’
‘And what is a fashion book?’ the younger one asked. He 
obviously regarded the other as an authority.
‘A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they 
come to the tailors here every Saturday, by post from 
abroad, to show folks how to dress, the male sex as well as 
the female. They’re pictures. The gentlemen are generally 
wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles, they’re beyond 
anything you can fancy.’
‘There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,’ the young-
er cried enthusiastically, ‘except father and mother, there’s 
everything!’
‘Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,’ 
the elder declared sententiously.
Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room 
where the strong box, the bed, and the chest of drawers 
had been; the room seemed to him very tiny without furni-
ture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the corner 
showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it 
and went to the window. The elder workman looked at him 
askance.
‘What do you want?’ he asked suddenly.
Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage 
and pulled the bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. 
He rang it a second and a third time; he listened and re-
membered. The hideous and agonisingly fearful sensation 
he had felt then began to come back more and more vividly. 
He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more 
satisfaction.
 249‘Well, what do you want? Who are you?’ the workman 
shouted, going out to him. Raskolnikov went inside again.
‘I want to take a flat,’ he said. ‘I am looking round.’
‘It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought 
to come up with the porter.’
‘The floors have been washed, will they be painted?’ Ras-
kolnikov went on. ‘Is there no blood?’
‘What blood?’
‘Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. 
There was a perfect pool there.’
‘But who are you?’ the workman cried, uneasy.
‘Who am I?’
‘Yes.’
‘You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell 
you.’
The workmen looked at him in amazement.
‘It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. 
We must lock up,’ said the elder workman.
‘Very well, come along,’ said Raskolnikov indifferently, 
and going out first, he went slowly downstairs. ‘Hey, porter,’ 
he cried in the gateway.
At the entrance several people were standing, staring at 
the passers- by; the two porters, a peasant woman, a man 
in a long coat and a few others. Raskolnikov went straight 
up to them.
‘What do you want?’ asked one of the porters.
‘Have you been to the police office?’
‘I’ve just been there. What do you want?’
‘Is it open?’
 Crime and Punishment
250
‘Of course.’
‘Is the assistant there?’
‘He was there for a time. What do you want?’
Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost 
in thought.
‘He’s been to look at the flat,’ said the elder workman, 
coming forward.
‘Which flat?’
‘Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the 
blood?’ says he. ‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and 
I’ve come to take it.’ And he began ringing at the bell, all but 
broke it. ‘Come to the police station,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you 
everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave us.’
The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and per-
plexed.
‘Who are you?’ he shouted as impressively as he could.
‘I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a stu-
dent, I live in Shil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, 
ask the porter, he knows me.’ Raskolnikov said all this in a 
lazy, dreamy voice, not turning round, but looking intently 
into the darkening street.
‘Why have you been to the flat?’
‘To look at it.’
‘What is there to look at?’
‘Take him straight to the police station,’ the man in the 
long coat jerked in abruptly.
Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder 
and said in the same slow, lazy tones:
‘Come along.’
 251‘Yes, take him,’ the man went on more confidently. ‘Why 
was he going into that what’s in his mind, eh?’
‘He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with 
him,’ muttered the workman.
‘But what do you want?’ the porter shouted again, be-
ginning to get angry in earnest—‘Why are you hanging 
about?’
‘You funk the police station then?’ said Raskolnikov jeer-
ingly.
‘How funk it? Why are you hanging about?’
‘He’s a rogue!’ shouted the peasant woman.
‘Why waste time talking to him?’ cried the other porter, 
a huge peasant in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. 
‘Get along! He is a rogue and no mistake. Get along!’
And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him 
into the street. He lurched forward, but recovered his foot-
ing, looked at the spectators in silence and walked away.
‘Strange man!’ observed the workman.
‘There are strange folks about nowadays,’ said the wom-
an.
‘You should have taken him to the police station all the 
same,’ said the man in the long coat.
‘Better have nothing to do with him,’ decided the big por-
ter. ‘A regular rogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, 
but once take him up, you won’t get rid of him…. We know 
the sort!’
‘Shall I go there or not?’ thought Raskolnikov, standing 
in the middle of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he 
looked about him, as though expecting from someone a de-
 Crime and Punishment
252
cisive word. But no sound came, all was dead and silent like 
the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to him alone…. 
All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards away, 
in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and 
shouts. In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage…. A 
light gleamed in the middle of the street. ‘What is it?’ Ras-
kolnikov turned to the right and went up to the crowd. He 
seemed to clutch at everything and smiled coldly when he 
recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to the 
police station and knew that it would all soon be over.

## Chapter 7

A
n elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with 
a pair of spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and 
the coachman had got off his box and stood by; the hors-
es were being held by the bridle…. A mass of people had 
gathered round, the police standing in front. One of them 
held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something 
lying close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, 
exclaiming; the coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeat-
ing:
‘What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!’
Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and 
succeeded at last in seeing the object of the commotion and 
interest. On the ground a man who had been run over lay 
apparently unconscious, and covered with blood; he was 
very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was flow-
ing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated 
and disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.
‘Merciful heaven!’ wailed the coachman, ‘what more 
could I do? If I’d been driving fast or had not shouted to 
him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could 
see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken 
man can’t walk straight, we all know…. I saw him cross-
ing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again 
and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but 
 Crime and Punishment
254
he fell straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose 
or he was very tipsy…. The horses are young and ready to 
take fright … they started, he screamed … that made them 
worse. That’s how it happened!’
‘That’s just how it was,’ a voice in the crowd confirmed.
‘He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,’ another 
voice declared.
‘Three times it was, we all heard it,’ shouted a third.
But the coachman was not very much distressed and 
frightened. It was evident that the carriage belonged to a 
rich and important person who was awaiting it somewhere; 
the police, of course, were in no little anxiety to avoid up-
setting his arrangements. All they had to do was to take the 
injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one 
knew his name.
Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped 
closer over him. The lantern suddenly lighted up the unfor-
tunate man’s face. He recognised him.
‘I know him! I know him!’ he shouted, pushing to the 
front. ‘It’s a government clerk retired from the service, 
Marmeladov. He lives close by in Kozel’s house…. Make 
haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?’ He pulled money out of 
his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in vio-
lent agitation.
The police were glad that they had found out who the 
man was. Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, 
as earnestly as if it had been his father, he besought the po-
lice to carry the unconscious Marmeladov to his lodging at 
once.
 255‘Just here, three houses away,’ he said eagerly, ‘the house 
belongs to Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no 
doubt drunk. I know him, he is a drunkard. He has a fam-
ily there, a wife, children, he has one daughter…. It will 
take time to take him to the hospital, and there is sure to 
be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will 
be looked after at home … they will help him at once. But 
he’ll die before you get him to the hospital.’ He managed to 
slip something unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the 
thing was straightforward and legitimate, and in any case 
help was closer here. They raised the injured man; people 
volunteered to help.
Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked 
behind, carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing 
the way.
‘This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head fore-
most. Turn round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,’ he 
muttered.
Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at 
every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room 
from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded 
across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. Of late she 
had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, Polen-
ka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not 
understand, understood very well that her mother needed 
her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and 
strove her utmost to appear to understand. This time Polen-
ka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell 
all day and was going to bed. The boy was waiting for her 
 Crime and Punishment
256
to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. He 
was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, 
serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him 
—heels together and toes turned out.
He was listening to what his mother was saying to his 
sister, sitting perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open 
eyes, just as all good little boys have to sit when they are 
undressed to go to bed. A little girl, still younger, dressed 
literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. 
The door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little 
from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the 
other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in 
the poor, consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed 
to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic 
flush on her face was brighter than ever.
‘You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,’ she 
said, walking about the room, ‘what a happy luxurious 
life we had in my papa’s house and how this drunkard has 
brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! Papa was a civ-
il colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that 
everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, 
Ivan Mihailovitch, as our governor!’ When I … when …’ 
she coughed violently, ‘oh, cursed life,’ she cried, clearing 
her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, ‘when I … 
when at the last ball … at the marshal’s … Princess Bezze-
melny saw me—who gave me the blessing when your father 
and I were married, Polenka—she asked at once ‘Isn’t that 
the pretty girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-
up?’ (You must mend that tear, you must take your needle 
 257and darn it as I showed you, or to-morrow—cough, cough, 
cough—he will make the hole bigger,’ she articulated with 
effort.) ‘Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just 
come from Petersburg then … he danced the mazurka with 
me and wanted to make me an offer next day; but I thanked 
him in flattering expressions and told him that my heart 
had long been another’s. That other was your father, Polya; 
papa was fearfully angry…. Is the water ready? Give me the 
shirt, and the stockings! Lida,’ said she to the youngest one, 
‘you must manage without your chemise to-night … and lay 
your stockings out with it … I’ll wash them together…. How 
is it that drunken vagabond doesn’t come in? He has worn 
his shirt till it looks like a dish- clout, he has torn it to rags! 
I’d do it all together, so as not to have to work two nights 
running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again! 
What’s this?’ she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and 
the men, who were pushing into her room, carrying a bur-
den. ‘What is it? What are they bringing? Mercy on us!’
‘Where are we to put him?’ asked the policeman, looking 
round when Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with 
blood, had been carried in.
‘On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head 
this way,’ Raskolnikov showed him.
‘Run over in the road! Drunk!’ someone shouted in the 
passage.
Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for 
breath. The children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, 
rushed to Polenka and clutched at her, trembling all over.
Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to 
 Crime and Punishment
258
Katerina Ivanovna.
‘For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!’ he said, 
speaking quickly, ‘he was crossing the road and was run 
over by a carriage, don’t be frightened, he will come to, I 
told them bring him here … I’ve been here already, you re-
member? He will come to; I’ll pay!’
‘He’s done it this time!’ Katerina Ivanovna cried despair-
ingly and she rushed to her husband.
Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of 
those women who swoon easily. She instantly placed under 
the luckless man’s head a pillow, which no one had thought 
of and began undressing and examining him. She kept her 
head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips and sti-
fling the screams which were ready to break from her.
Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a 
doctor. There was a doctor, it appeared, next door but one.
‘I’ve sent for a doctor,’ he kept assuring Katerina Ivanov-
na, ‘don’t be uneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water? … and give 
me a napkin or a towel, anything, as quick as you can…. He 
is injured, but not killed, believe me…. We shall see what 
the doctor says!’
Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken 
chair in the corner, a large earthenware basin full of wa-
ter had been stood, in readiness for washing her children’s 
and husband’s linen that night. This washing was done by 
Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a week, if not of-
tener. For the family had come to such a pass that they were 
practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna 
could not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in 
 259the house, she preferred to wear herself out at night, work-
ing beyond her strength when the rest were asleep, so as to 
get the wet linen hung on a line and dry by the morning. 
She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request, but 
almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already 
succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing 
the blood off Marmeladov’s face.
Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and 
pressing her hands to her breast. She was in need of atten-
tion herself. Raskolnikov began to realise that he might 
have made a mistake in having the injured man brought 
here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.
‘Polenka,’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, ‘run to Sonia, make 
haste. If you don’t find her at home, leave word that her fa-
ther has been run over and that she is to come here at once … 
when she comes in. Run, Polenka! there, put on the shawl.’
‘Run your fastest!’ cried the little boy on the chair sud-
denly, after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, 
with round eyes, his heels thrust forward and his toes spread 
out.
Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that 
you couldn’t have dropped a pin. The policemen left, all ex-
cept one, who remained for a time, trying to drive out the 
people who came in from the stairs. Almost all Madame 
Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner 
rooms of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in 
the doorway, but afterwards they overflowed into the room. 
Katerina Ivanovna flew into a fury.
‘You might let him die in peace, at least,’ she shouted at 
 Crime and Punishment
260
the crowd, ‘is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With ciga-
rettes! (Cough, cough, cough!) You might as well keep your 
hats on…. And there is one in his hat! … Get away! You 
should respect the dead, at least!’
Her cough choked her—but her reproaches were not 
without result. They evidently stood in some awe of Kateri-
na Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after another, squeezed back 
into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satis-
faction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden 
accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, 
from which no living man is exempt, even in spite of the 
sincerest sympathy and compassion.
Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the 
hospital and saying that they’d no business to make a dis-
turbance here.
‘No business to die!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she 
was rushing to the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in 
the doorway came face to face with Madame Lippevechsel 
who had only just heard of the accident and ran in to restore 
order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and irresponsible 
German.
‘Ah, my God!’ she cried, clasping her hands, ‘your hus-
band drunken horses have trampled! To the hospital with 
him! I am the landlady!’
‘Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are 
saying,’ Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always 
took a haughty tone with the landlady that she might ‘re-
member her place’ and even now could not deny herself this 
satisfaction). ‘Amalia Ludwigovna …’
 261‘I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia 
Ludwigovna may not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.’
‘You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, 
and as I am not one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Le-
beziatnikov, who’s laughing behind the door at this moment 
(a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it again’ was in fact audible 
at the door) so I shall always call you Amalia Ludwigovna, 
though I fail to understand why you dislike that name. You 
can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaha-
rovitch; he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and 
to admit no one. Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn 
you the Governor-General, himself, shall be informed of 
your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew me as a girl; he 
remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been a 
benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharov-
itch had many friends and protectors, whom he abandoned 
himself from an honourable pride, knowing his unhappy 
weakness, but now (she pointed to Raskolnikov) a generous 
young man has come to our assistance, who has wealth and 
connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known 
from a child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna …’
All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quick-
er and quicker, but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina 
Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that instant the dying man re-
covered consciousness and uttered a groan; she ran to him. 
The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition 
or understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending 
over him. He drew deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed 
at the corners of his mouth and drops of perspiration came 
 Crime and Punishment
262
out on his forehead. Not recognising Raskolnikov, he began 
looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked at him 
with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.
‘My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,’ 
she said in despair. ‘We must take off his clothes. Turn a lit-
tle, Semyon Zaharovitch, if you can,’ she cried to him.
Marmeladov recognised her.
‘A priest,’ he articulated huskily.
Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head 
against the window frame and exclaimed in despair:
‘Oh, cursed life!’
‘A priest,’ the dying man said again after a moment’s si-
lence.
‘They’ve gone for him,’ Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, 
he obeyed her shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes 
he looked for her; she returned and stood by his pillow. He 
seemed a little easier but not for long.
Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was 
shaking in the corner, as though she were in a fit, and star-
ing at him with her wondering childish eyes.
‘A-ah,’ he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say 
something.
‘What now?’ cried Katerina Ivanovna.
‘Barefoot, barefoot!’ he muttered, indicating with fren-
zied eyes the child’s bare feet.
‘Be silent,’ Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, ‘you know 
why she is barefooted.’
‘Thank God, the doctor,’ exclaimed Raskolnikov, re-
lieved.
 263The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, 
looking about him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick 
man, took his pulse, carefully felt his head and with the 
help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the blood-stained 
shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed, 
crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were 
broken. On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sin-
ister-looking yellowish-black bruise—a cruel kick from the 
horse’s hoof. The doctor frowned. The policeman told him 
that he was caught in the wheel and turned round with it for 
thirty yards on the road.
‘It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,’ the 
doctor whispered softly to Raskolnikov.
‘What do you think of him?’ he asked.
‘He will die immediately.’
‘Is there really no hope?’
‘Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp…. His head is bad-
ly injured, too … Hm … I could bleed him if you like, but … 
it would be useless. He is bound to die within the next five 
or ten minutes.’
‘Better bleed him then.’
‘If you like…. But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.’
At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the 
passage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, ap-
peared in the doorway bearing the sacrament. A policeman 
had gone for him at the time of the accident. The doctor 
changed places with him, exchanging glances with him. 
Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He 
shrugged his shoulders and remained.
 Crime and Punishment

All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The 
dying man probably understood little; he could only ut-
ter indistinct broken sounds. Katerina Ivanovna took little 
Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt down in the cor-
ner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her. 
The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on 
his little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing 
himself with precision and bowed down, touching the floor 
with his forehead, which seemed to afford him especial sat-
isfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her lips and held back her 
tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the 
boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders 
with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without ris-
ing from her knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door 
from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again. In 
the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the 
staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture 
beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the 
scene.
At that moment Polenka forced her way through the 
crowd at the door. She came in panting from running so 
fast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up 
to her and said, ‘She’s coming, I met her in the street.’ Her 
mother made her kneel beside her.
Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way 
through the crowd, and strange was her appearance in 
that room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair. 
She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of the cheapest, but 
decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp, unmistakably 
 265betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the 
doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of 
everything. She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so 
unseemly here with its ridiculous long train, and her im-
mense crinoline that filled up the whole doorway, and her 
light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought with her, 
though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw 
hat with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rak-
ishly-tilted hat was a pale, frightened little face with lips 
parted and eyes staring in terror. Sonia was a small thin 
girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful 
blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the priest; she 
too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some 
words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down 
and took a step forward into the room, still keeping close 
to the door.
The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her 
husband again. The priest stepped back and turned to say a 
few words of admonition and consolation to Katerina Iva-
novna on leaving.
‘What am I to do with these?’ she interrupted sharply 
and irritably, pointing to the little ones.
‘God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,’ the 
priest began.
‘Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.’
‘That’s a sin, a sin, madam,’ observed the priest, shaking 
his head.
‘And isn’t that a sin?’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing 
to the dying man.
 Crime and Punishment
266
‘Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the acci-
dent will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of 
his earnings.’
‘You don’t understand!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily 
waving her hand. ‘And why should they compensate me? 
Why, he was drunk and threw himself under the horses! 
What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery. He 
drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get 
drink, he wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank 
God he’s dying! One less to keep!’
‘You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, mad-
am, such feelings are a great sin.’
Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she 
was giving him water, wiping the blood and sweat from his 
head, setting his pillow straight, and had only turned now 
and then for a moment to address the priest. Now she flew 
at him almost in a frenzy.
‘Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d 
not been run over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and 
his only shirt dirty and in rags and he’d have fallen asleep 
like a log, and I should have been sousing and rinsing till 
daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s and then 
drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight 
I should have been darning them. That’s how I spend my 
nights! … What’s the use of talking of forgiveness! I have 
forgiven as it is!’
A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put 
her handkerchief to her lips and showed it to the priest, 
pressing her other hand to her aching chest. The handker-
 267chief was covered with blood. The priest bowed his head 
and said nothing.
Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his 
eyes off the face of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending 
over him again. He kept trying to say something to her; he 
began moving his tongue with difficulty and articulating 
indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he 
wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:
‘Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!’ And 
the sick man was silent, but at the same instant his wander-
ing eyes strayed to the doorway and he saw Sonia.
Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the 
shadow in a corner.
‘Who’s that? Who’s that?’ he said suddenly in a thick 
gasping voice, in agitation, turning his eyes in horror to-
wards the door where his daughter was standing, and trying 
to sit up.
‘Lie down! Lie do-own!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna.
With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping 
himself on his elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some 
time on his daughter, as though not recognising her. He had 
never seen her before in such attire. Suddenly he recognised 
her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy 
finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dy-
ing father. His face showed intense suffering.
‘Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!’ he cried, and he tried to hold 
out his hand to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the 
sofa, face downwards on the floor. They rushed to pick him 
up, they put him on the sofa; but he was dying. Sonia with 
 Crime and Punishment
268
a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so without 
moving. He died in her arms.
‘He’s got what he wanted,’ Katerina Ivanovna cried, see-
ing her husband’s dead body. ‘Well, what’s to be done now? 
How am I to bury him! What can I give them to-morrow 
to eat?’
Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.
‘Katerina Ivanovna,’ he began, ‘last week your husband 
told me all his life and circumstances…. Believe me, he 
spoke of you with passionate reverence. From that evening, 
when I learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he 
loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna, in 
spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we be-
came friends…. Allow me now … to do something … to 
repay my debt to my dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I 
think—and if that can be of any assistance to you, then … I 
… in short, I will come again, I will be sure to come again … 
I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow…. Good-bye!’
And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way 
through the crowd to the stairs. But in the crowd he sud-
denly jostled against Nikodim Fomitch, who had heard of 
the accident and had come to give instructions in person. 
They had not met since the scene at the police station, but 
Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.
‘Ah, is that you?’ he asked him.
‘He’s dead,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘The doctor and the 
priest have been, all as it should have been. Don’t worry the 
poor woman too much, she is in consumption as it is. Try 
and cheer her up, if possible … you are a kind-hearted man, 
 269I know …’ he added with a smile, looking straight in his 
face.
‘But you are spattered with blood,’ observed Nikodim 
Fomitch, noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on 
Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.
‘Yes … I’m covered with blood,’ Raskolnikov said with a 
peculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.
He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but 
not conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelm-
ing sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly 
within him. This sensation might be compared to that of a 
man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned. 
Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest 
on his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a 
silent greeting with him. He was just descending the last 
steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him. someone 
overtook him; it was Polenka. She was running after him, 
calling ‘Wait! wait!’
He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase 
and stopped short a step above him. A dim light came in 
from the yard. Raskolnikov could distinguish the child’s 
thin but pretty little face, looking at him with a bright child-
ish smile. She had run after him with a message which she 
was evidently glad to give.
‘Tell me, what is your name? … and where do you live?’ 
she said hurriedly in a breathless voice.
He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her 
with a sort of rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, 
he could not have said why.

‘Who sent you?’
‘Sister Sonia sent me,’ answered the girl, smiling still 
more brightly.
‘I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.’
‘Mamma sent me, too … when sister Sonia was sending 
me, mamma came up, too, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’’
‘Do you love sister Sonia?’
‘I love her more than anyone,’ Polenka answered with a 
peculiar earnestness, and her smile became graver.
‘And will you love me?’
By way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching 
him, her full lips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her 
arms as thin as sticks held him tightly, her head rested on 
his shoulder and the little girl wept softly, pressing her face 
against him.
‘I am sorry for father,’ she said a moment later, raising 
her tear- stained face and brushing away the tears with her 
hands. ‘It’s nothing but misfortunes now,’ she added sud-
denly with that peculiarly sedate air which children try hard 
to assume when they want to speak like grown-up people.
‘Did your father love you?’
‘He loved Lida most,’ she went on very seriously without 
a smile, exactly like grown-up people, ‘he loved her be-
cause she is little and because she is ill, too. And he always 
used to bring her presents. But he taught us to read and me 
grammar and scripture, too,’ she added with dignity. ‘And 
mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she 
liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach 
me French, for it’s time my education began.’
 271‘And do you know your prayers?’
‘Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my 
prayers to myself as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida 
say them aloud with mother. First they repeat the ‘Ave Ma-
ria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord, forgive and bless sister 
Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and bless our sec-
ond father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is another 
one, but we do pray for the other as well.’
‘Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, 
too. ‘And Thy servant Rodion,’ nothing more.’
‘I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,’ the little girl de-
clared hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him 
and hugged him warmly once more.
Raskolnikov told her his name and address and prom-
ised to be sure to come next day. The child went away quite 
enchanted with him. It was past ten when he came out into 
the street. In five minutes he was standing on the bridge at 
the spot where the woman had jumped in.
‘Enough,’ he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. 
‘I’ve done with fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! 
Life is real! haven’t I lived just now? My life has not yet died 
with that old woman! The Kingdom of Heaven to her—and 
now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the reign 
of reason and light … and of will, and of strength … and 
now we will see! We will try our strength!’ he added defi-
antly, as though challenging some power of darkness. ‘And 
I was ready to consent to live in a square of space!
‘I am very weak at this moment, but … I believe my ill-
ness is all over. I knew it would be over when I went out. 
 Crime and Punishment
272
By the way, Potchinkov’s house is only a few steps away. I 
certainly must go to Razumihin even if it were not close 
by … let him win his bet! Let us give him some satisfaction, 
too—no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you 
can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by 
strength—that’s what they don’t know,’ he added proudly 
and self-confidently and he walked with flagging footsteps 
from the bridge. Pride and self-confidence grew continu-
ally stronger in him; he was becoming a different man every 
moment. What was it had happened to work this revolution 
in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a 
straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there 
was still life for him, that his life had not died with the old 
woman.’ Perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his con-
clusions, but he did not think of that.
‘But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in 
her prayers,’ the idea struck him. ‘Well, that was … in case 
of emergency,’ he added and laughed himself at his boyish 
sally. He was in the best of spirits.
He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already 
known at Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him 
the way. Half-way upstairs he could hear the noise and ani-
mated conversation of a big gathering of people. The door 
was wide open on the stairs; he could hear exclamations and 
discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the company 
consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the en-
try, where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind 
a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie 
and savouries, brought up from the landlady’s kitchen. Ras-
 273kolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran out delighted. At 
the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal 
to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin 
quite drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.
‘Listen,’ Raskolnikov hastened to say, ‘I’ve only just come 
to tell you you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows 
what may not happen to him. I can’t come in; I am so weak 
that I shall fall down directly. And so good evening and 
good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.’
‘Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re 
weak yourself, you must …’
‘And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has 
just peeped out?’
‘He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I ex-
pect, or perhaps he has come without being invited … I’ll 
leave uncle with them, he is an invaluable person, pity I 
can’t introduce you to him now. But confound them all 
now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh air, for 
you’ve come just in the nick of time—another two minutes 
and I should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot 
of wild stuff … you simply can’t imagine what men will say! 
Though why shouldn’t you imagine? Don’t we talk nonsense 
ourselves? And let them … that’s the way to learn not to! … 
Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.’
Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; 
he showed a special interest in him; soon his face bright-
ened.
‘You must go to bed at once,’ he pronounced, examining 
the patient as far as he could, ‘and take something for the 
 Crime and Punishment
274
night. Will you take it? I got it ready some time ago … a 
powder.’
‘Two, if you like,’ answered Raskolnikov. The powder was 
taken at once.
‘It’s a good thing you are taking him home,’ observed 
Zossimov to Razumihin—‘we shall see how he is to-mor-
row, to-day he’s not at all amiss—a considerable change 
since the afternoon. Live and learn …’
‘Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we 
were coming out?’ Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they 
were in the street. ‘I won’t tell you everything, brother, be-
cause they are such fools. Zossimov told me to talk freely to 
you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and after-
wards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his 
head that you are … mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the 
first place, you’ve three times the brains he has; in the sec-
ond, if you are not mad, you needn’t care a hang that he has 
got such a wild idea; and thirdly, that piece of beef whose 
specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental diseases, and 
what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your 
conversation to-day with Zametov.’
‘Zametov told you all about it?’
‘Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means 
and so does Zametov…. Well, the fact is, Rodya … the point 
is … I am a little drunk now…. But that’s … no matter … 
the point is that this idea … you understand? was just be-
ing hatched in their brains … you understand? That is, no 
one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea is too absurd 
and especially since the arrest of that painter, that bubble’s 
 275burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave 
Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time— that’s between 
ourselves, brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know 
of it; I’ve noticed he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise 
Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day it’s all cleared up. That Ilya 
Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He took advantage of your 
fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed of it himself 
now; I know that …’
Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk 
enough to talk too freely.
‘I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of 
paint,’ said Raskolnikov.
‘No need to explain that! And it wasn’t the paint only: 
the fever had been coming on for a month; Zossimov testi-
fies to that! But how crushed that boy is now, you wouldn’t 
believe! ‘I am not worth his little finger,’ he says. Yours, he 
means. He has good feelings at times, brother. But the les-
son, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais de Cristal, 
that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first, 
you know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost con-
vinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, 
and then you suddenly—put out your tongue at him: ‘There 
now, what do you make of it?’ It was perfect! He is crushed, 
annihilated now! It was masterly, by Jove, it’s what they 
deserve! Ah, that I wasn’t there! He was hoping to see you 
awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance …’
‘Ah! … he too … but why did they put me down as mad?’
‘Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother…. 
What struck him, you see, was that only that subject seemed 
 Crime and Punishment
276
to interest you; now it’s clear why it did interest you; know-
ing all the circumstances … and how that irritated you and 
worked in with your illness … I am a little drunk, brother, 
only, confound him, he has some idea of his own … I tell 
you, he’s mad on mental diseases. But don’t you mind him 
…’
For half a minute both were silent.
‘Listen, Razumihin,’ began Raskolnikov, ‘I want to tell 
you plainly: I’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died 
… I gave them all my money … and besides I’ve just been 
kissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, would just 
the same … in fact I saw someone else there … with a flame-
coloured feather … but I am talking nonsense; I am very 
weak, support me … we shall be at the stairs directly …’
‘What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?’ Razu-
mihin asked anxiously.
‘I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so 
sad … like a woman. Look, what’s that? Look, look!’
‘What is it?’
‘Don’t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the 
crack …’
They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at 
the level of the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see 
from below that there was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret.
‘Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,’ observed Razumihin.
‘She is never in my room at this time and she must be in 
bed long ago, but … I don’t care! Good-bye!’
‘What do you mean? I am coming with you, we’ll come 
in together!’
 277‘I know we are going in together, but I want to shake 
hands here and say good-bye to you here. So give me your 
hand, good-bye!’
‘What’s the matter with you, Rodya?’
‘Nothing … come along … you shall be witness.’
They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Ra-
zumihin that perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. ‘Ah, 
I’ve upset him with my chatter!’ he muttered to himself.
When they reached the door they heard voices in the 
room.
‘What is it?’ cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first 
to open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the door-
way, dumbfoundered.
His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had 
been waiting an hour and a half for him. Why had he never 
expected, never thought of them, though the news that they 
had started, were on their way and would arrive immediate-
ly, had been repeated to him only that day? They had spent 
that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She 
was standing before them and had told them everything by 
now. They were beside themselves with alarm when they 
heard of his ‘running away’ to-day, ill and, as they under-
stood from her story, delirious! ‘Good Heavens, what had 
become of him?’ Both had been weeping, both had been in 
anguish for that hour and a half.
A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. 
Both rushed to him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden 
intolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt. He did 
not lift his arms to embrace them, he could not. His mother 
 Crime and Punishment
278
and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him, laughed 
and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground, 
fainting.
Anxiety, cries of horror, moans … Razumihin who was 
standing in the doorway flew into the room, seized the sick 
man in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the 
sofa.
‘It’s nothing, nothing!’ he cried to the mother and sister—
‘it’s only a faint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said 
he was much better, that he is perfectly well! Water! See, he 
is coming to himself, he is all right again!’
And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislo-
cated it, he made her bend down to see that ‘he is all right 
again.’ The mother and sister looked on him with emotion 
and gratitude, as their Providence. They had heard already 
from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya during 
his illness, by this ‘very competent young man,’ as Pulche-
ria Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in 
conversation with Dounia.
