## Chapter 1

T
he morning that followed the fateful interview with 
Dounia and her mother brought sobering influenc-
es to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch. Intensely unpleasant as it 
was, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond 
recall what had seemed to him only the day before fan-
tastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity 
had been gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out 
of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the look-
ing-glass. He was afraid that he had jaundice. However his 
health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, 
clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, 
Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in 
the conviction that he would find another bride and, per-
haps, even a better one. But coming back to the sense of 
his present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, 
which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch 
Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was stay-
ing. That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it 
down against his young friend’s account. He had set down 
a good many points against him of late. His anger was re-
doubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told 
Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s inter-
view. That was the second mistake he had made in temper, 
through impulsiveness and irritability…. Moreover, all that 
 509morning one unpleasantness followed another. He even 
found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate. 
He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which 
had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and 
was being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich 
German tradesman, would not entertain the idea of break-
ing the contract which had just been signed and insisted 
on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr Petrovitch would 
be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In the 
same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble 
of the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not 
yet removed to the flat.
‘Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?’ 
Pyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once 
more he had a gleam of desperate hope. ‘Can all that be re-
ally so irrevocably over? Is it no use to make another effort?’ 
The thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his 
heart. He endured anguish at that moment, and if it had 
been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, 
Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.
‘It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,’ 
he thought, as he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s 
room, ‘and why on earth was I such a Jew? It was false econ-
omy! I meant to keep them without a penny so that they 
should turn to me as their providence, and look at them! 
foo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for 
the trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, 
jewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp’s 
and the English shop, my position would have been better 
 Crime and Punishment
510
and … stronger! They could not have refused me so easily! 
They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return 
money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find 
it hard to do it! And their conscience would prick them: 
how can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so gener-
ous and delicate?…. H’m! I’ve made a blunder.’
And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called 
himself a fool— but not aloud, of course.
He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. 
The preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanov-
na’s excited his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it 
the day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, 
but absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention. In-
quiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy laying the 
table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he 
heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all 
the lodgers had been invited, among them some who had 
not known the dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch 
Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel 
with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch, was not 
only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most 
important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been 
invited with great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleas-
antness, and so she was very busy with preparations and 
was taking a positive pleasure in them; she was moreover 
dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she was 
proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch 
and he went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, some-
what thoughtful. He had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be 
 511one of the guests.
Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morn-
ing. The attitude of Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was 
strange, though perhaps natural. Pyotr Petrovitch had de-
spised and hated him from the day he came to stay with him 
and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He 
had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg 
simply from parsimony, though that had been perhaps his 
chief object. He had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who 
had once been his ward, as a leading young progressive who 
was taking an important part in certain interesting circles, 
the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had 
impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient cir-
cles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had 
long inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm. He 
had not, of course, been able to form even an approximate 
notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard 
that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of 
some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he ex-
aggerated and distorted the significance of those words to 
an absurd degree. What for many years past he had feared 
more than anything was being shown up and this was the 
chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of 
transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of 
this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some 
years before, when he was just entering on his own career, 
he had come upon two cases in which rather important 
personages in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly 
shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal for the 
 Crime and Punishment
512
person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in se-
rious trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to 
go into the subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if 
necessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour 
of ‘our younger generation.’ He relied on Andrey Semyo-
novitch for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had 
succeeded in picking up some current phrases. He soon 
discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace 
simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. 
Even if he had been certain that all the progressives were 
fools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness. All 
the doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which Andrey 
Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him. He had 
his own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what 
was happening here. Had these people any power or not? 
Had he anything to fear from them? Would they expose any 
enterprise of his? And what precisely was now the object of 
their attacks? Could he somehow make up to them and get 
round them if they really were powerful? Was this the thing 
to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In 
fact hundreds of questions presented themselves.
Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little 
man, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which 
he was very proud. He was a clerk and had almost always 
something wrong with his eyes. He was rather soft-heart-
ed, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited 
in speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with 
his little figure. He was one of the lodgers most respected 
by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did not get drunk and paid reg-
 513ularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch really was 
rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress 
and ‘our younger generation’ from enthusiasm. He was one 
of the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-an-
imate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who 
attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vul-
garise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however 
sincerely.
Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was 
beginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on 
both sides unconsciously. However simple Andrey Semyo-
novitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch was 
duping him and secretly despising him, and that ‘he was 
not the right sort of man.’ He had tried expounding to him 
the system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late 
Pyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even 
to be rude. The fact was he had begun instinctively to guess 
that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simple-
ton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections 
of any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply 
picked things up third-hand; and that very likely he did 
not even know much about his own work of propaganda, 
for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he would 
be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that 
Pyotr Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accept-
ed the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had 
not protested, for instance, when Andrey Semyonovitch 
belauded him for being ready to contribute to the establish-
ment of the new ‘commune,’ or to abstain from christening 
 Crime and Punishment
514
his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take 
a lover a month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch 
so enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain 
even such virtues when they were attributed to him.
Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to re-
alise some five- per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the 
table and counted over bundles of notes. Andrey Semyo-
novitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the 
room pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes 
with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have 
convinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch 
could really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on 
his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch was 
capable of entertaining such an idea about him and was, 
perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend 
by reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference 
between them.
He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though 
he, Andrey Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite 
subject, the foundation of a new special ‘commune.’ The 
brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between 
the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed 
unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the ‘humane’ 
Andrey Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-hu-
mour to his recent breach with Dounia and he was burning 
with impatience to discourse on that theme. He had some-
thing progressive to say on the subject which might console 
his worthy friend and ‘could not fail’ to promote his devel-
opment.
 515‘There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that … 
at the widow’s, isn’t there?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, 
interrupting Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting 
passage.
‘Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night 
what I think about all such ceremonies. And she invited you 
too, I heard. You were talking to her yesterday …’
‘I should never have expected that beggarly fool would 
have spent on this feast all the money she got from that 
other fool, Raskolnikov. I was surprised just now as I came 
through at the preparations there, the wines! Several people 
are invited. It’s beyond everything!’ continued Pyotr Petro-
vitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the 
conversation. ‘What? You say I am asked too? When was 
that? I don’t remember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only 
said a word to her in passing yesterday of the possibility of 
her obtaining a year’s salary as a destitute widow of a gov-
ernment clerk. I suppose she has invited me on that account, 
hasn’t she? He-he-he!’
‘I don’t intend to go either,’ said Lebeziatnikov.
‘I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You 
might well hesitate, he-he!’
‘Who thrashed? Whom?’ cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered 
and blushing.
‘Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. 
I heard so yesterday … so that’s what your convictions 
amount to … and the woman question, too, wasn’t quite 
sound, he-he-he!’ and Pyotr Petrovitch, as though comfort-
ed, went back to clicking his beads.
 Crime and Punishment
516
‘It’s all slander and nonsense!’ cried Lebeziatnikov, who 
was always afraid of allusions to the subject. ‘It was not like 
that at all, it was quite different. You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a 
libel. I was simply defending myself. She rushed at me first 
with her nails, she pulled out all my whiskers…. It’s per-
missable for anyone, I should hope, to defend himself and 
I never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle, for 
it’s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply pushed 
her back.’
‘He-he-he!’ Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.
‘You keep on like that because you are out of humour 
yourself…. But that’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing 
whatever to do with the woman question! You don’t under-
stand; I used to think, indeed, that if women are equal to 
men in all respects, even in strength (as is maintained now) 
there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I reflect-
ed afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise, 
for there ought not to be fighting and in the future soci-
ety fighting is unthinkable … and that it would be a queer 
thing to seek for equality in fighting. I am not so stupid … 
though, of course, there is fighting … there won’t be later, 
but at present there is … confound it! How muddled one 
gets with you! It’s not on that account that I am not going. 
I am not going on principle, not to take part in the revolt-
ing convention of memorial dinners, that’s why! Though, of 
course, one might go to laugh at it…. I am sorry there won’t 
be any priests at it. I should certainly go if there were.’
‘Then you would sit down at another man’s table and in-
sult it and those who invited you. Eh?’
 517‘Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a 
good object. I might indirectly assist the cause of enlight-
enment and propaganda. It’s a duty of every man to work 
for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, 
perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea…. And 
something might grow up from that seed. How should 
I be insulting them? They might be offended at first, but 
afterwards they’d see I’d done them a service. You know, 
Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed be-
cause when she left her family and … devoted … herself, 
she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn’t go on 
living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage 
and it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have 
spared them and have written more kindly. I think that’s 
all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the con-
trary, what’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married 
seven years, she abandoned her two children, she told her 
husband straight out in a letter: ‘I have realised that I can-
not be happy with you. I can never forgive you that you 
have deceived me by concealing from me that there is an-
other organisation of society by means of the communities. 
I have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to 
whom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing 
a community. I speak plainly because I consider it dishon-
est to deceive you. Do as you think best. Do not hope to get 
me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’ That’s 
how letters like that ought to be written!’
‘Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free 
marriage?’
 Crime and Punishment
518
‘No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the 
fourth, what if it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! 
And if ever I regretted the death of my father and mother, 
it is now, and I sometimes think if my parents were living 
what a protest I would have aimed at them! I would have 
done something on purpose … I would have shown them! 
I would have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no 
one!’
‘To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,’ Pyotr 
Petrovitch interrupted, ‘but tell me this; do you know the 
dead man’s daughter, the delicate-looking little thing? It’s 
true what they say about her, isn’t it?’
‘What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal convic-
tion that this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I 
mean, distinguons. In our present society it is not altogether 
normal, because it is compulsory, but in the future society it 
will be perfectly normal, because it will be voluntary. Even 
as it is, she was quite right: she was suffering and that was 
her asset, so to speak, her capital which she had a perfect 
right to dispose of. Of course, in the future society there 
will be no need of assets, but her part will have another sig-
nificance, rational and in harmony with her environment. 
As to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as 
a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and 
I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at 
her!’
‘I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.’
Lebeziatnikov was enraged.
‘That’s another slander,’ he yelled. ‘It was not so at all! 
 519That was all Katerina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not 
understand! And I never made love to Sofya Semyonovna! 
I was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying 
to rouse her to protest…. All I wanted was her protest and 
Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!’
‘Have you asked her to join your community?’
‘You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me 
to tell you. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a 
community. The community is established that there should 
be no such rôles. In a community, such a rôle is essentially 
transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there, what, 
under present conditions, is unnatural becomes perfectly 
natural in the community. It all depends on the environ-
ment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. 
And I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this 
day, which is a proof that she never regarded me as having 
wronged her. I am trying now to attract her to the commu-
nity, but on quite, quite a different footing. What are you 
laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of our 
own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone fur-
ther in our convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile 
I’m still developing Sofya Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, 
beautiful character!’
‘And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-
he!’
‘No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.’
‘Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!’
‘Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it 
strange myself how timid, chaste and modern she is with 
 Crime and Punishment
520
me!’
‘And you, of course, are developing her … he-he! trying 
to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense?’
‘Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly—excuse 
me saying so—you misunderstand the word development! 
Good heavens, how … crude you still are! We are striving 
for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in 
your head…. Setting aside the general question of chastity 
and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed 
prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because 
that’s for her to decide. Of course if she were to tell me her-
self that she wanted me, I should think myself very lucky, 
because I like the girl very much; but as it is, no one has ever 
treated her more courteously than I, with more respect for 
her dignity … I wait in hopes, that’s all!’
‘You had much better make her a present of something. I 
bet you never thought of that.’
‘You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, 
she is in such a position, but it’s another question. Quite an-
other question! You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which 
you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you re-
fuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature. You don’t 
know what a character she is! I am only sorry that of late 
she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used 
to lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the en-
ergy and resolution in protesting—which she has already 
shown once—she has little self-reliance, little, so to say, in-
dependence, so as to break free from certain prejudices and 
certain foolish ideas. Yet she thoroughly understands some 
 521questions, for instance about kissing of hands, that is, that 
it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her hand, be-
cause it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and 
I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account 
of the workmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am ex-
plaining the question of coming into the room in the future 
society.’
‘And what’s that, pray?’
‘We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of 
the community the right to enter another member’s room, 
whether man or woman, at any time … and we decided that 
he has!’
‘It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!’
Lebeziatnikov was really angry.
‘You are always thinking of something unpleasant,’ he 
cried with aversion. ‘Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was 
expounding our system, I referred prematurely to the ques-
tion of personal privacy! It’s always a stumbling-block to 
people like you, they turn it into ridicule before they under-
stand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often 
maintained that that question should not be approached by 
a novice till he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, 
please, what do you find so shameful even in cesspools? I 
should be the first to be ready to clean out any cesspool you 
like. And it’s not a question of self-sacrifice, it’s simply work, 
honourable, useful work which is as good as any other and 
much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, be-
cause it is more useful.’
‘And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!’
 Crime and Punishment
522
‘What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t under-
stand such expressions to describe human activity. ‘More 
honourable,’ ‘nobler’— all those are old-fashioned prejudic-
es which I reject. Everything which is of use to mankind is 
honourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can 
snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!’
Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished 
counting the money and was putting it away. But some of 
the notes he left on the table. The ‘cesspool question’ had 
already been a subject of dispute between them. What was 
absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it 
amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted 
to anger his young friend.
‘It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-hu-
moured and annoying,’ blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in 
spite of his ‘independence’ and his ‘protests’ did not venture 
to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still behaved to him with 
some of the respect habitual in earlier years.
‘You’d better tell me this,’ Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted 
with haughty displeasure, ‘can you … or rather are you re-
ally friendly enough with that young person to ask her to 
step in here for a minute? I think they’ve all come back from 
the cemetery … I heard the sound of steps … I want to see 
her, that young person.’
‘What for?’ Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.
‘Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow 
and therefore I wanted to speak to her about … However, 
you may be present during the interview. It’s better you 
should be, indeed. For there’s no knowing what you might 
 523imagine.’
‘I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve 
anything to say to her, nothing is easier than to call her in. 
I’ll go directly and you may be sure I won’t be in your way.’
Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. 
She came in very much surprised and overcome with shy-
ness as usual. She was always shy in such circumstances and 
was always afraid of new people, she had been as a child 
and was even more so now…. Pyotr Petrovitch met her 
‘politely and affably,’ but with a certain shade of bantering 
familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of 
his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so 
young and so interesting as she. He hastened to ‘reassure’ 
her and made her sit down facing him at the table. Sonia 
sat down, looked about her—at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes 
lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and 
her eyes remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was mov-
ing to the door. Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain 
seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.
‘Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?’ he asked him in 
a whisper.
‘Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just 
come in…. Why?’
‘Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and 
not to leave me alone with this … young woman. I only want 
a few words with her, but God knows what they may make 
of it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to repeat anything…. You 
understand what I mean?’
‘I understand!’ Lebeziatnikov saw the point. ‘Yes, you are 
 Crime and Punishment
524
right…. Of course, I am convinced personally that you have 
no reason to be uneasy, but … still, you are right. Certainly 
I’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the window and not be in your way 
… I think you are right …’
Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite 
Sonia, looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely 
dignified, even severe expression, as much as to say, ‘don’t 
you make any mistake, madam.’ Sonia was overwhelmed 
with embarrassment.
‘In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my 
excuses to your respected mamma…. That’s right, isn’t it? 
Katerina Ivanovna stands in the place of a mother to you?’ 
Pyotr Petrovitch began with great dignity, though affably.
It was evident that his intentions were friendly.
‘Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,’ Sonia answered, 
timidly and hurriedly.
‘Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevi-
table circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not 
be at the dinner in spite of your mamma’s kind invitation.’
‘Yes … I’ll tell her … at once.’
And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.
‘Wait, that’s not all,’ Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smil-
ing at her simplicity and ignorance of good manners, ‘and 
you know me little, my dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you sup-
pose I would have ventured to trouble a person like you for a 
matter of so little consequence affecting myself only. I have 
another object.’
Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an 
instant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that re-
 525mained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed 
her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it horribly indecorous, 
especially for her to look at another person’s money. She 
stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in 
his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome 
ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly 
she looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by 
staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face. After a 
pause of still greater dignity he continued.
‘I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple 
of words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was 
sufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position—
preternatural, if one may so express it.’
‘Yes … preternatural …’ Sonia hurriedly assented.
‘Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, 
ill.’
‘Yes, simpler and more comprehen … yes, ill.’
‘Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to 
speak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in 
any way, foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the 
whole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely 
on you?’
‘Allow me to ask,’ Sonia rose to her feet, ‘did you say 
something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension? 
Because she told me you had undertaken to get her one. 
Was that true?’
‘Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely 
hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow 
of an official who had died in the service—if only she has 
 Crime and Punishment
526
patronage … but apparently your late parent had not served 
his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all 
of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very 
ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance 
in that case, far from it…. And she is dreaming of a pension 
already, he-he-he! … A go-ahead lady!’
‘Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and 
she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and 
… and … and she is like that … yes … You must excuse her,’ 
said Sonia, and again she got up to go.
‘But you haven’t heard what I have to say.’
‘No, I haven’t heard,’ muttered Sonia.
‘Then sit down.’ She was terribly confused; she sat down 
again a third time.
‘Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I 
should be glad, as I have said before, so far as lies in my 
power, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not 
more. One might for instance get up a subscription for her, 
or a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always ar-
ranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous 
of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; 
it might be done.’
‘Yes, yes … God will repay you for it,’ faltered Sonia, gaz-
ing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch.
‘It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might be-
gin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the 
foundation so to speak. Come to me at seven o’clock. Mr. 
Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But there is one cir-
cumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for 
 527which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come 
here. In my opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe 
to put it into Katerina Ivanovna’s own hands. The dinner 
to-day is a proof of that. Though she has not, so to speak, 
a crust of bread for to-morrow and … well, boots or shoes, 
or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even, 
I believe, Madeira and … and coffee. I saw it as I passed 
through. To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they 
won’t have a crust of bread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my 
thinking, a subscription ought to be raised so that the un-
happy widow should not know of the money, but only you, 
for instance. Am I right?’
‘I don’t know … this is only to-day, once in her life…. She 
was so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory…. 
And she is very sensible … but just as you think and I shall 
be very, very … they will all be … and God will reward … 
and the orphans …’
Sonia burst into tears.
‘Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you ac-
cept for the benefit of your relation the small sum that I am 
able to spare, from me personally. I am very anxious that 
my name should not be mentioned in connection with it. 
Here … having so to speak anxieties of my own, I cannot 
do more …’
And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note 
carefully unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped 
up, muttered something and began taking leave. Pyotr 
Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously to the door. 
She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed, and 
 Crime and Punishment
528
returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confu-
sion.
All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or 
walked about the room, anxious not to interrupt the con-
versation; when Sonia had gone he walked up to Pyotr 
Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.
‘I heard and saw everything,’ he said, laying stress on the 
last verb. ‘That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! 
You wanted to avoid gratitude, I saw! And although I can-
not, I confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, 
for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, 
yet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure—yes, 
yes, I like it.’
‘That’s all nonsense,’ muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, some-
what disconcerted, looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.
‘No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered dis-
tress and annoyance as you did yesterday and who yet can 
sympathise with the misery of others, such a man … even 
though he is making a social mistake—is still deserving of 
respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr Petrovitch, 
especially as according to your ideas … oh, what a drawback 
your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance 
by your ill-luck yesterday,’ cried the simple-hearted Lebezi-
atnikov, who felt a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. 
‘And, what do you want with marriage, with legal marriage, 
my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do you cling to this 
legality of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you like, but I 
am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are free, 
that you are not quite lost for humanity…. you see, I’ve spo-
 529ken my mind!’
‘Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a 
fool of and to bring up another man’s children, that’s why I 
want legal marriage,’ Luzhin replied in order to make some 
answer.
He seemed preoccupied by something.
‘Children? You referred to children,’ Lebeziatnikov start-
ed off like a warhorse at the trumpet call. ‘Children are a 
social question and a question of first importance, I agree; 
but the question of children has another solution. Some re-
fuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the 
institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later, but 
now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak 
point. That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is un-
thinkable in the dictionary of the future. What does it mean 
indeed? It’s nonsense, there will be no deception in a free 
marriage! That is only the natural consequence of a legal 
marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest. So that indeed 
it’s not humiliating … and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, 
were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it. 
I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, 
now I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You 
laugh! That’s because you are of incapable of getting away 
from prejudices. Confound it all! I understand now where 
the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, 
but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable po-
sition in which both are humiliated. When the deception 
is open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s un-
thinkable. Your wife will only prove how she respects you 
 Crime and Punishment
530
by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness 
and avenging yourself on her for her new husband. Damn it 
all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married, pfoo! I mean 
if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same, I should 
present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for 
herself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more 
than that I desire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?’
Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without 
much merriment. He hardly heard it indeed. He was pre-
occupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at 
last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed 
his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected 
upon it afterwards.

## Chapter 2

I
t would be difficult to explain exactly what could have 
originated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina 
Ivanovna’s disordered brain. Nearly ten of the twenty rou-
bles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s funeral, were 
wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to 
honour the memory of the deceased ‘suitably,’ that all the 
lodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know ‘that 
he was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their 
superior,’ and that no one had the right ‘to turn up his nose 
at him.’ Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar ‘poor 
man’s pride,’ which compels many poor people to spend 
their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, sim-
ply in order to do ‘like other people,’ and not to ‘be looked 
down upon.’ It is very probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna 
longed on this occasion, at the moment when she seemed 
to be abandoned by everyone, to show those ‘wretched con-
temptible lodgers’ that she knew ‘how to do things, how to 
entertain’ and that she had been brought up ‘in a genteel, she 
might almost say aristocratic colonel’s family’ and had not 
been meant for sweeping floors and washing the children’s 
rags at night. Even the poorest and most broken-spirited 
people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride 
and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous 
craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; 
 Crime and Punishment
532
she might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit 
could not have been broken, that is, she could not have been 
intimidated, her will could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia 
had said with good reason that her mind was unhinged. She 
could not be said to be insane, but for a year past she had 
been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained. 
The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to 
affect the intellect.
There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Ma-
deira; but wine there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon 
wine, all of the poorest quality but in sufficient quantity. Be-
sides the traditional rice and honey, there were three or four 
dishes, one of which consisted of pancakes, all prepared 
in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were boiling, 
that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Kateri-
na Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, 
with the help of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little 
Pole who had somehow been stranded at Madame Lippe-
vechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina Ivanovna’s 
disposal and had been all that morning and all the day be-
fore running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and 
very anxious that everyone should be aware of it. For ev-
ery trifle he ran to Katerina Ivanovna, even hunting her out 
at the bazaar, at every instant called her ‘Pani. ’ She was 
heartily sick of him before the end, though she had de-
clared at first that she could not have got on without this 
‘serviceable and magnanimous man.’ It was one of Katerina 
Ivanovna’s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the 
most glowing colours. Her praises were so exaggerated as 
 533sometimes to be embarrassing; she would invent various 
circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and 
quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden 
she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemp-
tuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before 
been literally adoring. She was naturally of a gay, lively and 
peace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and 
misfortunes she had come to desire so keenly that all should 
live in peace and joy and should not dare to break the peace, 
that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her al-
most to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the 
brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving, 
and knocking her head against the wall.
Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary 
importance in Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated 
by her with extraordinary respect, probably only because 
Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart and soul into the 
preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table, to pro-
vide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her 
kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands 
and gone herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well 
done. Even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, 
knives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and 
patterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was prop-
erly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she 
had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and 
a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning 
party with some pride. This pride, though justifiable, dis-
pleased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: ‘as though the 
 Crime and Punishment
534
table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!’ 
She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. ‘Could she be 
stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of 
the house, and had consented as a favour to help her poor 
lodgers! As a favour! Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father 
who had been a colonel and almost a governor had some-
times had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone 
like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not 
have been allowed into the kitchen.’
Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feel-
ings for the time and contented herself with treating her 
coldly, though she decided inwardly that she would cer-
tainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her 
proper place, for goodness only knew what she was fancying 
herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that 
hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, 
except the Pole who had just managed to run into the cem-
etery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most 
insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, 
many of them not quite sober. The older and more respect-
able of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away. Pyotr 
Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the 
most respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though 
Katerina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, 
that is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that 
he was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large 
property and vast connections, who had been a friend of 
her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s house, and 
that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a 
 535considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina 
Ivanovna exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was 
without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the 
mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person 
praised. Probably ‘taking his cue’ from Luzhin, ‘that con-
temptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. 
What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kind-
ness and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr 
Petrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have 
been awkward not to invite him.’
Among those who failed to appear were ‘the genteel lady 
and her old- maidish daughter,’ who had only been lodg-
ers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times 
complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna’s 
room, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk. 
Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, 
quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn 
the whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they 
‘were not worth the foot’ of the honourable lodgers whom 
they were disturbing. Katerina Ivanovna determined now 
to invite this lady and her daughter, ‘whose foot she was not 
worth,’ and who had turned away haughtily when she casu-
ally met them, so that they might know that ‘she was more 
noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour mal-
ice,’ and might see that she was not accustomed to her way 
of living. She had proposed to make this clear to them at 
dinner with allusions to her late father’s governorship, and 
also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid 
of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major 
 Crime and Punishment
536
(he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also ab-
sent, but it appeared that he had been ‘not himself’ for the 
last two days. The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched 
looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had 
not a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf 
and almost blind old man who had once been in the post of-
fice and who had been from immemorial ages maintained 
by someone at Amalia Ivanovna’s.
A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, 
too; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and 
only fancy—was without a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat 
straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina 
Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit appeared in 
his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts 
of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing 
him. The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles 
who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s and whom no one 
had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna 
intensely. ‘For whom had they made all these preparations 
then?’ To make room for the visitors the children had not 
even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were 
sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner 
laid on a box, while Polenka as a big girl had to look after 
them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred 
children’s.
Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting 
her guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness. 
She stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily 
invited them to take their seats. Rushing to the conclusion 
 537that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who 
were absent, she began treating her with extreme noncha-
lance, which the latter promptly observed and resented. 
Such a beginning was no good omen for the end. All were 
seated at last.
Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their re-
turn from the cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly 
delighted to see him, in the first place, because he was the 
one ‘educated visitor, and, as everyone knew, was in two 
years to take a professorship in the university,’ and sec-
ondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised 
for having been unable to be at the funeral. She positive-
ly pounced upon him, and made him sit on her left hand 
(Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In spite of her continu-
al anxiety that the dishes should be passed round correctly 
and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonis-
ing cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed 
to have grown worse during the last few days, she hastened 
to pour out in a half whisper to Raskolnikov all her sup-
pressed feelings and her just indignation at the failure of 
the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and un-
controllable laughter at the expense of her visitors and 
especially of her landlady.
‘It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? 
Her, her!’ Katerina Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. 
‘Look at her, she’s making round eyes, she feels that we are 
talking about her and can’t understand. Pfoo, the owl! Ha-
ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that 
cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she 
 Crime and Punishment
538
wants everyone to consider that she is patronising me and 
doing me an honour by being here? I asked her like a sen-
sible woman to invite people, especially those who knew my 
late husband, and look at the set of fools she has brought! 
The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And 
those wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) 
Not one of them has ever poked his nose in here, I’ve nev-
er set eyes on them. What have they come here for, I ask 
you? There they sit in a row. Hey, pan!’ she cried suddenly 
to one of them, ‘have you tasted the pancakes? Take some 
more! Have some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, 
he’s jumped up and is making his bows, they must be quite 
starved, poor things. Never mind, let them eat! They don’t 
make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid for our land-
lady’s silver spoons … Amalia Ivanovna!’ she addressed her 
suddenly, almost aloud, ‘if your spoons should happen to 
be stolen, I won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!’ 
She laughed turning to Raskolnikov, and again nodding 
towards the landlady, in high glee at her sally. ‘She didn’t 
understand, she didn’t understand again! Look how she sits 
with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new rib-
bons, ha-ha-ha!’
Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of 
coughing that lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration 
stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained 
with blood. She showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence, 
and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering 
to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on 
her cheeks.
 539‘Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, 
so to speak, for inviting that lady and her daughter, you 
understand of whom I am speaking? It needed the utmost 
delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she has managed things so 
that that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial non-
entity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and has 
come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in 
the government offices, because at fifty she paints her face 
(everybody knows it) … a creature like that did not think fit 
to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which 
the most ordinary good manners required! I can’t under-
stand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But where’s 
Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what 
is it, Sonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your 
father’s funeral you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Ro-
manovitch, make room for her beside you. That’s your place, 
Sonia … take what you like. Have some of the cold entrée 
with jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes direct-
ly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you 
got everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be 
a good girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit 
like a little gentleman. What are you saying, Sonia?’
Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apolo-
gies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and 
carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she 
attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added that Pyotr Petro-
vitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as he 
possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss busi-
ness alone with her and to consider what could be done for 
 Crime and Punishment
540
her, etc., etc.
Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, 
would flatter her and gratify her pride. She sat down be-
side Raskolnikov; she made him a hurried bow, glancing 
curiously at him. But for the rest of the time she seemed to 
avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed ab-
sent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, 
trying to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had 
been able to get mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, 
and Katerina Ivanovna had on her only dress, a dark striped 
cotton one.
The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. 
Listening to Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired 
with equal dignity how Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once 
whispered almost aloud to Raskolnikov that it certainly 
would have been strange for a man of Pyotr Petrovitch’s po-
sition and standing to find himself in such ‘extraordinary 
company,’ in spite of his devotion to her family and his old 
friendship with her father.
‘That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, 
that you have not disdained my hospitality, even in such 
surroundings,’ she added almost aloud. ‘But I am sure that 
it was only your special affection for my poor husband that 
has made you keep your promise.’
Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her 
visitors, and suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the 
deaf man: ‘Wouldn’t he have some more meat, and had he 
been given some wine?’ The old man made no answer and 
for a long while could not understand what he was asked, 
 541though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and 
shaking him. He simply gazed about him with his mouth 
open, which only increased the general mirth.
‘What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? 
But as to Pyotr Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him,’ 
Katerina Ivanovna continued, ‘and, of course, he is not 
like …’ with an extremely stern face she addressed Amalia 
Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter was quite dis-
concerted, ‘not like your dressed up draggletails whom my 
father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and 
my late husband would have done them honour if he had 
invited them in the goodness of his heart.’
‘Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!’ 
cried the commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth 
glass of vodka.
‘My late husband certainly had that weakness, and every-
one knows it,’ Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, ‘but 
he was a kind and honourable man, who loved and respect-
ed his family. The worst of it was his good nature made him 
trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he drank with fel-
lows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you 
believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread 
cock in his pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget 
the children!’
‘A cock? Did you say a cock?’ shouted the commissariat 
clerk.
Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, 
lost in thought.
‘No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too se-
 Crime and Punishment
542
vere with him,’ she went on, addressing Raskolnikov. ‘But 
that’s not so! He respected me, he respected me very much! 
He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was for him 
sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used 
to feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him 
and then would think to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will 
drink again,’ it was only by severity that you could keep him 
within bounds.’
‘Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,’ roared 
the commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of 
vodka.
‘Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as 
well as having their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late 
husband now!’ Katerina Ivanovna snapped at him.
The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her 
chest heaved. In another minute she would have been ready 
to make a scene. Many of the visitors were sniggering, evi-
dently delighted. They began poking the commissariat clerk 
and whispering something to him. They were evidently try-
ing to egg him on.
‘Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,’ began the 
clerk, ‘that is to say, whose … about whom … did you say 
just now … But I don’t care! That’s nonsense! Widow! I for-
give you…. Pass!’
And he took another drink of vodka.
Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only 
ate from politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Iva-
novna was continually putting on his plate, to avoid hurting 
her feelings. He watched Sonia intently. But Sonia became 
 543more and more anxious and distressed; she, too, foresaw 
that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with ter-
ror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that 
she, Sonia, was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ con-
temptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. She 
had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother was posi-
tively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: 
‘How could she let her daughter sit down beside that young 
person?’ Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had 
already heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to 
Katerina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or 
her father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not 
be satisfied now, ‘till she had shown those draggletails that 
they were both …’ To make matters worse someone passed 
Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two 
hearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Kateri-
na Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across 
the table that the man who sent it was ‘a drunken ass!’
Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and 
at the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s 
haughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the com-
pany and raise herself in their esteem she began, apropos of 
nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers ‘Karl 
from the chemist’s,’ who was driving one night in a cab, and 
that ‘the cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much 
begged him not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and 
frightened and from fear pierced his heart.’ Though Kat-
erina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that Amalia 
Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter 
 Crime and Punishment
544
was still more offended, and she retorted that her ‘Vater aus 
Berlin was a very important man, and always went with his 
hands in pockets.’ Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain 
herself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost pa-
tience and could scarcely control herself.
‘Listen to the owl!’ Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, 
her good- humour almost restored, ‘she meant to say he 
kept his hands in his pockets, but she said he put his hands 
in people’s pockets. (Cough- cough.) And have you noticed, 
Rodion Romanovitch, that all these Petersburg foreign-
ers, the Germans especially, are all stupider than we! Can 
you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’ 
‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of 
punishing the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and 
much begged.’ Ah, the fool! And you know she fancies it’s 
very touching and does not suspect how stupid she is! To my 
thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great deal 
cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains 
with drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so 
well behaved and serious…. Look how she sits glaring! She 
is angry, ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.)’
Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began 
at once telling Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her 
pension, she intended to open a school for the daughters 
of gentlemen in her native town T——. This was the first 
time she had spoken to him of the project, and she launched 
out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that 
Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of 
honour of which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov 
 545in the tavern, when he told him that Katerina Ivanovna, his 
wife, had danced the shawl dance before the governor and 
other great personages on leaving school. This certificate of 
honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina Iva-
novna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed 
herself with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming 
‘those two stuck-up draggletails’ if they came to the din-
ner, and proving incontestably that Katerina Ivanovna was 
of the most noble, ‘she might even say aristocratic family, a 
colonel’s daughter and was far superior to certain adven-
turesses who have been so much to the fore of late.’ The 
certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of 
the drunken guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to 
retain it, for it actually contained the statement en toutes 
lettres that her father was of the rank of a major, and also 
a companion of an order, so that she really was almost the 
daughter of a colonel.
Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge 
on the peaceful and happy life they would lead in T——, 
on the gymnasium teachers whom she would engage to 
give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most respect-
able old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina 
Ivanovna herself in old days and was still living in T——, 
and would no doubt teach in her school on moderate terms. 
Next she spoke of Sonia who would go with her to T—— 
and help her in all her plans. At this someone at the further 
end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.
Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdain-
fully unaware of it, she raised her voice and began at once 
 Crime and Punishment
546
speaking with conviction of Sonia’s undoubted ability to 
assist her, of ‘her gentleness, patience, devotion, generosity 
and good education,’ tapping Sonia on the cheek and kiss-
ing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina 
Ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing 
that she was ‘nervous and silly, that she was too much upset, 
that it was time to finish, and as the dinner was over, it was 
time to hand round the tea.’
At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at 
taking no part in the conversation, and not being listened 
to, made one last effort, and with secret misgivings ven-
tured on an exceedingly deep and weighty observation, that 
‘in the future boarding-school she would have to pay partic-
ular attention to die Wäsche and that there certainly must 
be a good dame to look after the linen, and secondly that 
the young ladies must not novels at night read.’
Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very 
tired, as well as heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short 
Amalia Ivanovna, saying ‘she knew nothing about it and 
was talking nonsense, that it was the business of the laundry 
maid, and not of the directress of a high- class boarding-
school to look after die Wäsche and as for novel- reading, 
that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.’ 
Amalia Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that 
she only ‘meant her good,’ and that ‘she had meant her very 
good,’ and that ‘it was long since she had paid her gold for 
the lodgings.’
Katerina Ivanovna at once ‘set her down,’ saying that it 
was a lie to say she wished her good, because only yester-
 547day when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had 
worried her about the lodgings. To this Amalia Ivanovna 
very appropriately observed that she had invited those la-
dies, but ‘those ladies had not come, because those ladies 
are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.’ Kat-
erina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a 
slut she could not judge what made one really a lady. Amalia 
Ivanovna at once declared that her ‘Vater aus Berlin was a 
very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, 
and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’’ and she leapt up from 
the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her 
pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds 
resembling ‘poof! poof!’ amid loud laughter from all the 
lodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hop-
ing for a fight.
But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at 
once declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanov-
na probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken 
Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and 
probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red 
as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna 
never had a father, ‘but she had a Vater aus Berlin and that 
he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!’
Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all 
knew what her family was and that on that very certificate 
of honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, 
while Amalia Ivanovna’s father—if she really had one—was 
probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she 
never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether 
 Crime and Punishment
548
her name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.
At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the 
table with her fist, and shrieked that she was Amalia Iva-
novna, and not Ludwigovna, ‘that her Vater was named 
Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina 
Ivanovna’s Vater was quite never a burgomeister.’ Katerina 
Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and appar-
ently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was 
heaving) observed that ‘if she dared for one moment to set 
her contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, 
she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head 
and trample it under foot.’ Amalia Ivanovna ran about the 
room, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress 
of the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the 
lodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to 
collect the silver spoons from the table. There was a great 
outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia ran 
to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna 
shouted something about ‘the yellow ticket,’ Katerina Iva-
novna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to 
carry out her threat.
At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch 
Luzhin appeared on the threshold. He stood scanning the 
party with severe and vigilant eyes. Katerina Ivanovna 
rushed to him.

## Chapter 3

‘
Pyotr Petrovitch,’ she cried, ‘protect me … you at least! 
Make this foolish woman understand that she can’t be-
have like this to a lady in misfortune … that there is a law 
for such things…. I’ll go to the governor-general himself…. 
She shall answer for it…. Remembering my father’s hospi-
tality protect these orphans.’
‘Allow me, madam…. Allow me.’ Pyotr Petrovitch waved 
her off. ‘Your papa as you are well aware I had not the hon-
our of knowing’ (someone laughed aloud) ‘and I do not 
intend to take part in your everlasting squabbles with Ama-
lia Ivanovna…. I have come here to speak of my own affairs 
… and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya 
… Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.’
Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite 
corner where Sonia was.
Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, 
as though thunderstruck. She could not understand how 
Pyotr Petrovitch could deny having enjoyed her father’s 
hospitility. Though she had invented it herself, she believed 
in it firmly by this time. She was struck too by the business-
like, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr 
Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his en-
trance. Not only was this ‘serious business man’ strikingly 
incongruous with the rest of the party, but it was evident, 
 Crime and Punishment
550
too, that he had come upon some matter of consequence, 
that some exceptional cause must have brought him and 
that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, 
standing beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr 
Petrovitch did not seem to notice him. A minute later Lebe-
ziatnikov, too, appeared in the doorway; he did not come in, 
but stood still, listening with marked interest, almost won-
der, and seemed for a time perplexed.
‘Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter 
of some importance,’ Pyotr Petrovitch observed, address-
ing the company generally. ‘I am glad indeed to find other 
persons present. Amalia Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as 
mistress of the house to pay careful attention to what I have 
to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,’ he went on, ad-
dressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already 
alarmed, ‘immediately after your visit I found that a hun-
dred-rouble note was missing from my table, in the room 
of my friend Mr. Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you 
know and will tell us where it is now, I assure you on my 
word of honour and call all present to witness that the mat-
ter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be compelled 
to have recourse to very serious measures and then … you 
must blame yourself.’
Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the cry-
ing children were still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at 
Luzhin and unable to say a word. She seemed not to under-
stand. Some seconds passed.
‘Well, how is it to be then?’ asked Luzhin, looking intent-
ly at her.
 551‘I don’t know…. I know nothing about it,’ Sonia articu-
lated faintly at last.
‘No, you know nothing?’ Luzhin repeated and again he 
paused for some seconds. ‘Think a moment, mademoiselle,’ 
he began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her. 
‘Reflect, I am prepared to give you time for consideration. 
Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely convinced I 
should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture 
to accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accu-
sation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should 
myself in a certain sense be made responsible, I am aware 
of that. This morning I changed for my own purposes sev-
eral five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately 
three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my 
pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the 
money—as Mr. Lebeziatnikov will bear witness—and after 
counting two thousand three hundred roubles I put the rest 
in my pocket-book in my coat pocket. About five hundred 
roubles remained on the table and among them three notes 
of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at 
my invitation)—and all the time you were present you were 
exceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped 
up in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off. 
Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this. You yourself, 
mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my state-
ment that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely 
in order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute po-
sition of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner 
I was unable to attend), and the advisability of getting up 
 Crime and Punishment
552
something of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the 
like, for her benefit. You thanked me and even shed tears. 
I describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to 
your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest 
detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten- rou-
ble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first 
instalment on my part for the benefit of your relative. Mr. 
Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then I accompanied you to the 
door—you being still in the same state of embarrassment—
after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I talked 
to him for ten minutes— then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out 
and I returned to the table with the money lying on it, in-
tending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing 
before. To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disap-
peared. Kindly consider the position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I 
cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such a suppo-
sition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for 
the minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts 
and found the total correct. You will admit that recollect-
ing your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and 
the fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, 
and taking into consideration your social position and the 
habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and 
positively against my will, compelled to entertain a suspi-
cion—a cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further 
and repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, I realise 
that I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as 
you see, I could not let it pass. I have taken action and I will 
tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black in-
 553gratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your destitute 
relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and 
you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It 
is too bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true 
friend I beg you— and you could have no better friend at 
this moment—think what you are doing, otherwise I shall 
be immovable! Well, what do you say?’
‘I have taken nothing,’ Sonia whispered in terror, ‘you 
gave me ten roubles, here it is, take it.’
Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied 
a corner of it, took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to 
Luzhin.
‘And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?’ 
he insisted reproachfully, not taking the note.
Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such 
awful, stern, ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskol-
nikov … he stood against the wall, with his arms crossed, 
looking at her with glowing eyes.
‘Good God!’ broke from Sonia.
‘Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the po-
lice and therefore I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for 
the house porter,’ Luzhin said softly and even kindly.
‘Gott der Barmherzige! I knew she was the thief,’ cried 
Amalia Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.
‘You knew it?’ Luzhin caught her up, ‘then I suppose you 
had some reason before this for thinking so. I beg you, wor-
thy Amalia Ivanovna, to remember your words which have 
been uttered before witnesses.’
There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All 
 Crime and Punishment
554
were in movement.
‘What!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the 
position, and she rushed at Luzhin. ‘What! You accuse her 
of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the wretches, the wretches!’
And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round 
her and held her as in a vise.
‘Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish 
girl! Give it to me! Give me the ten roubles at once—here!
And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna 
crumpled it up and flung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It 
hit him in the eye and fell on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna 
hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch lost his temper.
‘Hold that mad woman!’ he shouted.
At that moment several other persons, besides Lebezi-
atnikov, appeared in the doorway, among them the two 
ladies.
‘What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!’ shrieked Katerina Iva-
novna. ‘You are an idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base 
man! Sonia, Sonia take his money! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d 
give away her last penny!’ and Katerina Ivanovna broke 
into hysterical laughter. ‘Did you ever see such an idiot?’ 
she turned from side to side. ‘And you too?’ she suddenly 
saw the landlady, ‘and you too, sausage eater, you declare 
that she is a thief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crino-
line! She hasn’t been out of this room: she came straight 
from you, you wretch, and sat down beside me, everyone 
saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search her! 
Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be 
on her! Search her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then 
 555excuse me, my dear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to 
our Sovereign, to our Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar him-
self, and throw myself at his feet, to-day, this minute! I am 
alone in the world! They would let me in! Do you think they 
wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in! You reck-
oned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not 
so submissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. 
Search her, search her!’
And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and 
dragged him towards Sonia.
‘I am ready, I’ll be responsible … but calm yourself, mad-
am, calm yourself. I see that you are not so submissive! … 
Well, well, but as to that …’ Luzhin muttered, ‘that ought to 
be before the police … though indeed there are witnesses 
enough as it is…. I am ready…. But in any case it’s difficult 
for a man … on account of her sex…. But with the help of 
Amalia Ivanovna … though, of course, it’s not the way to do 
things…. How is it to be done?’
‘As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!’ cried Kat-
erina Ivanovna. ‘Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, 
monster, the pocket is empty, here was her handkerchief! 
Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see, d’you see?’
And Katerina Ivanovna turned—or rather snatched—
both pockets inside out. But from the right pocket a piece 
of paper flew out and describing a parabola in the air fell 
at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several cried out. Pyotr 
Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two fin-
gers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a 
hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held 
 Crime and Punishment
556
up the note showing it to everyone.
‘Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!’ yelled Amalia 
Ivanovna. ‘They must to Siberia be sent! Away!’
Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, 
keeping his eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional 
rapid glance at Luzhin. Sonia stood still, as though uncon-
scious. She was hardly able to feel surprise. Suddenly the 
colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry and hid her 
face in her hands.
‘No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,’ 
she cried with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina 
Ivanovna, who clasped her tightly in her arms, as though 
she would shelter her from all the world.
‘Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!’ 
she cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and 
fro in her arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then 
snatching at her hands and kissing them, too, ‘you took it! 
How stupid these people are! Oh dear! You are fools, fools,’ 
she cried, addressing the whole room, ‘you don’t know, you 
don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she is! She take 
it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help you 
if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow pass-
port because my children were starving, she sold herself for 
us! Ah, husband, husband! Do you see? Do you see? What 
a memorial dinner for you! Merciful heavens! Defend her, 
why are you all standing still? Rodion Romanovitch, why 
don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You are 
not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! 
Defend her now, at least!’
 557The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman 
seemed to produce a great effect on her audience. The ago-
nised, wasted, consumptive face, the parched blood-stained 
lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained as a child’s, the 
trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help were so 
piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petro-
vitch at any rate was at once moved to compassion.
‘Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!’ 
he cried impressively, ‘no one would take upon himself to 
accuse you of being an instigator or even an accomplice in 
it, especially as you have proved her guilt by turning out 
her pockets, showing that you had no previous idea of it. I 
am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if pover-
ty, so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did 
you refuse to confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the 
disgrace? The first step? You lost your head, perhaps? One 
can quite understand it…. But how could you have lowered 
yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,’ he addressed the 
whole company, ‘gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say, 
commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even 
now in spite of the personal insult lavished upon me! And 
may this disgrace be a lesson to you for the future,’ he said, 
addressing Sonia, ‘and I will carry the matter no further. 
Enough!’
Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes 
met, and the fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce 
him to ashes. Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna apparently 
heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging Sonia like a 
madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on all 
 Crime and Punishment
558
sides, and Polenka—though she did not fully understand 
what was wrong—was drowned in tears and shaking with 
sobs, as she hid her pretty little face, swollen with weeping, 
on Sonia’s shoulder.
‘How vile!’ a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.
‘What vileness!’ Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him 
straight in the face.
Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start—all noticed it and 
recalled it afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.
‘And you dared to call me as witness?’ he said, going up 
to Pyotr Petrovitch.
‘What do you mean? What are you talking about?’ mut-
tered Luzhin.
‘I mean that you … are a slanderer, that’s what my words 
mean!’ Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him 
with his short- sighted eyes.
He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently 
at him, as though seizing and weighing each word. Again 
there was a silence. Pyotr Petrovitch indeed seemed almost 
dumbfounded for the first moment.
‘If you mean that for me, …’ he began, stammering. ‘But 
what’s the matter with you? Are you out of your mind?’
‘I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! 
I have heard everything. I kept waiting on purpose to un-
derstand it, for I must own even now it is not quite logical…. 
What you have done it all for I can’t understand.’
‘Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your 
nonsensical riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!’
 559‘You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! 
I never touch vodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would 
you believe it, he, he himself, with his own hands gave So-
fya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble note—I saw it, I was 
a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!’ repeated Lebezi-
atnikov, addressing all.
‘Are you crazy, milksop?’ squealed Luzhin. ‘She is her-
self before you —she herself here declared just now before 
everyone that I gave her only ten roubles. How could I have 
given it to her?’
‘I saw it, I saw it,’ Lebeziatnikov repeated, ‘and though 
it is against my principles, I am ready this very minute to 
take any oath you like before the court, for I saw how you 
slipped it in her pocket. Only like a fool I thought you did 
it out of kindness! When you were saying good-bye to her 
at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with the 
other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, 
I saw it!’
Luzhin turned pale.
‘What lies!’ he cried impudently, ‘why, how could you, 
standing by the window, see the note? You fancied it with 
your short-sighted eyes. You are raving!’
‘No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some 
way off, I saw it all. And though it certainly would be hard 
to distinguish a note from the window—that’s true—I knew 
for certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when 
you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you 
took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it be-
cause I was standing near then, and an idea struck me at 
 Crime and Punishment
560
once, so that I did not forget you had it in your hand). You 
folded it and kept it in your hand all the time. I didn’t think 
of it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it 
from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it! I 
noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you 
meant to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can 
fancy how I watched you and I saw how you succeeded in 
slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I saw it, I’ll take my 
oath.’
Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose 
on all hands chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were 
menacing in tone. They all crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. 
Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.
‘I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one 
to take her part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!’
Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, 
sank on her knees before him.
‘A pack of nonsense!’ yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, ‘it’s 
all nonsense you’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you 
didn’t think, you noticed’—what does it amount to? So I 
gave it to her on the sly on purpose? What for? With what 
object? What have I to do with this …?’
‘What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what 
I am telling you is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my 
being mistaken, you infamous criminal man, I remember 
how, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, 
just when I was thanking you and pressing your hand. 
What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did 
it secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from 
 561me, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours 
and that I do not approve of private benevolence, which ef-
fects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you really were 
ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps, 
too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she 
finds a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I 
know, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out 
their charitable actions in that way.) Then the idea struck 
me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether, when 
she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that 
you wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your 
right hand should not know … something of that sort, in 
fact. I thought of so many possibilities that I put off con-
sidering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that 
I knew your secret. But another idea struck me again that 
Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she 
noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call 
her out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred 
roubles in her pocket. But on my way I went first to Ma-
dame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the ‘General Treatise on 
the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend Piderit’s 
article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what 
a state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these 
ideas and reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-
rouble note in her pocket?’
When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue 
with the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, 
and the perspiration streamed from his face. He could not, 
alas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he 
 Crime and Punishment
562
knew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, 
almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech 
produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such ve-
hemence, with such conviction that everyone obviously 
believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt that things were going 
badly with him.
‘What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?’ 
he shouted, ‘that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, 
that’s all! And I tell you, you are lying, sir. You are lying and 
slandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, 
because I did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, 
social propositions!’
But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Mur-
murs of disapproval were heard on all sides.
‘Ah, that’s your line now, is it!’ cried Lebeziatnikov, ‘that’s 
nonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only 
one thing I can’t understand: what made him risk such a 
contemptible action. Oh, pitiful, despicable man!’
‘I can explain why he risked such an action, and if nec-
essary, I, too, will swear to it,’ Raskolnikov said at last in a 
firm voice, and he stepped forward.
He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt 
clearly, from the very look of him that he really knew about 
it and that the mystery would be solved.
‘Now I can explain it all to myself,’ said Raskolnikov, ad-
dressing Lebeziatnikov. ‘From the very beginning of the 
business, I suspected that there was some scoundrelly in-
trigue at the bottom of it. I began to suspect it from some 
special circumstances known to me only, which I will ex-
 563plain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your 
valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I 
beg all, all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) 
was recently engaged to be married to a young lady—my 
sister, Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikov. But coming to 
Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day before yesterday, 
at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room —I 
have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man…. 
The day before yesterday I did not know that he was stay-
ing here, in your room, and that consequently on the very 
day we quarrelled—the day before yesterday—he saw me 
give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a 
friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note 
to my mother and informed her that I had given away all my 
money, not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, 
and referred in a most contemptible way to the … charac-
ter of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of 
my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you understand 
was with the object of dividing me from my mother and 
sister, by insinuating that I was squandering on unwor-
thy objects the money which they had sent me and which 
was all they had. Yesterday evening, before my mother and 
sister and in his presence, I declared that I had given the 
money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to So-
fya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya 
Semyonovna and had never seen her before, indeed. At the 
same time I added that he, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with 
all his virtues, was not worth Sofya Semyonovna’s little fin-
ger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his question—would I 
 Crime and Punishment
564
let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I answered 
that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother 
and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insin-
uations, he gradually began being unpardonably rude to 
them. A final rupture took place and he was turned out of 
the house. All this happened yesterday evening. Now I beg 
your special attention: consider: if he had now succeeded in 
proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would have 
shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in 
his suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my put-
ting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in 
attacking me, he was protecting and preserving the honour 
of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might even, through 
all this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and 
no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say 
nothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he has 
grounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of 
Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to me. That was what 
he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s the 
whole reason for it and there can be no other!’
It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov 
wound up his speech which was followed very attentively, 
though often interrupted by exclamations from his audi-
ence. But in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly, calmly, 
exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of conviction 
and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.
‘Yes, yes, that’s it,’ Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, ‘that 
must be it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna 
came into our room, whether you were here, whether I had 
 565seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s guests. He called me 
aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was essential 
for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!’
Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But 
he was very pale. He seemed to be deliberating on some 
means of escape. Perhaps he would have been glad to give 
up everything and get away, but at the moment this was 
scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth 
of the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the com-
pany, which had already been excited by drink, was now too 
much stirred to allow it. The commissariat clerk, though in-
deed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting 
louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very 
unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; 
lodgers came in from all the rooms. The three Poles were 
tremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: 
‘The pan is a lajdak!’ and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia 
had been listening with strained attention, though she too 
seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had 
just returned to consciousness. She did not take her eyes off 
Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina 
Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearful-
ly exhausted. Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid 
than anyone, with her mouth wide open, unable to make 
out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr Petrovitch 
had somehow come to grief.
Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they 
did not let him. Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with 
threats and shouts of abuse. But Pyotr Petrovitch was not 
 Crime and Punishment
566
intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of Sonia had com-
pletely failed, he had recourse to insolence:
‘Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me 
pass!’ he said, making his way through the crowd. ‘And no 
threats, if you please! I assure you it will be useless, you will 
gain nothing by it. On the contrary, you’ll have to answer, 
gentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice. 
The thief has been more than unmasked, and I shall pros-
ecute. Our judges are not so blind and … not so drunk, 
and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infi-
dels, agitators, and atheists, who accuse me from motives of 
personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit…. 
Yes, allow me to pass!’
‘Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave 
at once, and everything is at an end between us! When I 
think of the trouble I’ve been taking, the way I’ve been ex-
pounding … all this fortnight!’
‘I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried 
to keep me; now I will simply add that you are a fool. I ad-
vise you to see a doctor for your brains and your short sight. 
Let me pass, gentlemen!’
He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk 
was unwilling to let him off so easily: he picked up a glass 
from the table, brandished it in the air and flung it at Pyotr 
Petrovitch; but the glass flew straight at Amalia Ivanovna. 
She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing, fell heavily un-
der the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room 
and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by 
nature, had felt before that day that she could be ill- treated 
 567more easily than anyone, and that she could be wronged 
with impunity. Yet till that moment she had fancied that she 
might escape misfortune by care, gentleness and submis-
siveness before everyone. Her disappointment was too great. 
She could, of course, bear with patience and almost with-
out murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute 
she felt it too bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justifi-
cation—when her first terror and stupefaction had passed 
and she could understand it all clearly—the feeling of her 
helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart 
throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical 
weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out 
of the room and ran home, almost immediately after Lu-
zhin’s departure. When amidst loud laughter the glass flew 
at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the landlady could 
endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina Iva-
novna, considering her to blame for everything.
‘Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!’
And with these words she began snatching up every-
thing she could lay her hands on that belonged to Katerina 
Ivanovna, and throwing it on the floor. Katerina Ivanovna, 
pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up 
from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and dart-
ed at Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the 
landlady waved her away like a feather.
‘What! As though that godless calumny was not enough—
this vile creature attacks me! What! On the day of my 
husband’s funeral I am turned out of my lodging! After eat-
ing my bread and salt she turns me into the street, with my 
 Crime and Punishment
568
orphans! Where am I to go?’ wailed the poor woman, sob-
bing and gasping. ‘Good God!’ she cried with flashing eyes, 
‘is there no justice upon earth? Whom should you protect 
if not us orphans? We shall see! There is law and justice on 
earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit, godless creature! Po-
lenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait for me, if 
you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is 
justice on earth!’
And throwing over her head that green shawl which 
Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina 
Ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and 
drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, 
wailing and tearful, she ran into the street—with a vague 
intention of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polen-
ka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, 
on the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited 
trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia Ivanovna 
raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing 
everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked 
incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability 
on what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one 
another, while others struck up a song….
‘Now it’s time for me to go,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Well, 
Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’
And he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.

## Chapter 4

R
askolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion 
of Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load 
of horror and anguish in his own heart. But having gone 
through so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief 
in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal 
feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agi-
tated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his 
approaching interview with Sonia: he had to tell her who 
had killed Lizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it would 
be to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it. 
So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, ‘Well, So-
fya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’ he was 
still superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from 
his triumph over Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time 
he reached Sonia’s lodging, he felt a sudden impotence and 
fear. He stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself 
the strange question: ‘Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta?’ 
It was a strange question because he felt at the very time not 
only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could 
not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be 
so, he only felt it, and the agonising sense of his impotence 
before the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his 
hesitation and suffering, he quickly opened the door and 
looked at Sonia from the doorway. She was sitting with her 
 Crime and Punishment
570
elbows on the table and her face in her hands, but seeing 
Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as 
though she were expecting him.
‘What would have become of me but for you?’ she said 
quickly, meeting him in the middle of the room.
Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what 
she had been waiting for.
Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair 
from which she had only just risen. She stood facing him, 
two steps away, just as she had done the day before.
‘Well, Sonia?’ he said, and felt that his voice was trem-
bling, ‘it was all due to ‘your social position and the habits 
associated with it.’ Did you understand that just now?’
Her face showed her distress.
‘Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,’ she inter-
rupted him. ‘Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough 
without that.’
She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like 
the reproach.
‘I was silly to come away from there. What is happening 
there now? I wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking 
that … you would come.’
He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out 
of their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off
 
somewhere ‘to seek justice.’
‘My God!’ cried Sonia, ‘let’s go at once….’
And she snatched up her cape.
‘It’s everlastingly the same thing!’ said Raskolnikov, irri-
tably. ‘You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with 
 571me.’
‘But … Katerina Ivanovna?’
‘You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, 
she’ll come to you herself since she has run out,’ he added 
peevishly. ‘If she doesn’t find you here, you’ll be blamed for 
it….’
Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was si-
lent, gazing at the floor and deliberating.
‘This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,’ he be-
gan, not looking at Sonia, ‘but if he had wanted to, if it had 
suited his plans, he would have sent you to prison if it had 
not been for Lebeziatnikov and me. Ah?’
‘Yes,’ she assented in a faint voice. ‘Yes,’ she repeated, pre-
occupied and distressed.
‘But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite 
an accident Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.’
Sonia was silent.
‘And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remem-
ber what I said yesterday?’
Again she did not answer. He waited.
‘I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, 
leave off.’’ Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. 
‘What, silence again?’ he asked a minute later. ‘We must 
talk about something, you know. It would be interesting 
for me to know how you would decide a certain ‘problem’ 
as Lebeziatnikov would say.’ (He was beginning to lose the 
thread.) ‘No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you 
had known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, 
that is, for a fact, that they would be the ruin of Katerina 
 Crime and Punishment
572
Ivanovna and the children and yourself thrown in—since 
you don’t count yourself for anything—Polenka too … for 
she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on 
your decision whether he or they should go on living, that 
is whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked 
things, or Katerina Ivanovna should die? How would you 
decide which of them was to die? I ask you?’
Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something pecu-
liar in this hesitating question, which seemed approaching 
something in a roundabout way.
‘I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,’ 
she said, looking inquisitively at him.
‘I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?’
‘Why do you ask about what could not happen?’ said So-
nia reluctantly.
‘Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and do-
ing wicked things? You haven’t dared to decide even that!’
‘But I can’t know the Divine Providence…. And why do 
you ask what can’t be answered? What’s the use of such fool-
ish questions? How could it happen that it should depend 
on my decision—who has made me a judge to decide who is 
to live and who is not to live?’
‘Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there 
is no doing anything,’ Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.
‘You’d better say straight out what you want!’ Sonia cried 
in distress. ‘You are leading up to something again…. Can 
you have come simply to torture me?’
She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. 
He looked at her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.
 573‘Of course you’re right, Sonia,’ he said softly at last. He 
was suddenly changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and 
helpless defiance was gone. Even his voice was sudden-
ly weak. ‘I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask 
forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask for-
giveness…. I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my 
own sake. I was asking forgiveness, Sonia….’
He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and 
incomplete in his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his 
face in his hands.
And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of 
bitter hatred for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were 
wondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his 
head and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and 
painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; 
his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real feel-
ing; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant 
that that minute had come.
He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. 
Suddenly he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at 
Sonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically 
on her bed.
His sensations that moment were terribly like the mo-
ment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in 
his hand and felt that ‘he must not lose another minute.’
‘What’s the matter?’ asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.
He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all 
the way he had intended to ‘tell’ and he did not understand 
what was happening to him now. She went up to him, softly, 
 Crime and Punishment
574
sat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her 
eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It was unendur-
able; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked, 
helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror 
passed through Sonia’s heart.
‘What’s the matter?’ she repeated, drawing a little away 
from him.
‘Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened…. It’s nonsense. 
It really is nonsense, if you think of it,’ he muttered, like 
a man in delirium. ‘Why have I come to torture you?’ he 
added suddenly, looking at her. ‘Why, really? I keep asking 
myself that question, Sonia….’
He had perhaps been asking himself that question 
a quarter of an hour before, but now he spoke helplessly, 
hardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor 
all over.
‘Oh, how you are suffering!’ she muttered in distress, 
looking intently at him.
‘It’s all nonsense…. Listen, Sonia.’ He suddenly smiled, a 
pale helpless smile for two seconds. ‘You remember what I 
meant to tell you yesterday?’
Sonia waited uneasily.
‘I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye 
for ever, but that if I came to-day I would tell you who … 
who killed Lizaveta.’
She began trembling all over.
‘Well, here I’ve come to tell you.’
‘Then you really meant it yesterday?’ she whispered with 
difficulty. ‘How do you know?’ she asked quickly, as though 
 575suddenly regaining her reason.
Sonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed pain-
fully.
‘I know.’
She paused a minute.
‘Have they found him?’ she asked timidly.
‘No.’
‘Then how do you know about it?’ she asked again, hardly 
audibly and again after a minute’s pause.
He turned to her and looked very intently at her.
‘Guess,’ he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.
A shudder passed over her.
‘But you … why do you frighten me like this?’ she said, 
smiling like a child.
‘I must be a great friend of his … since I know,’ Raskol-
nikov went on, still gazing into her face, as though he could 
not turn his eyes away. ‘He … did not mean to kill that Liza-
veta … he … killed her accidentally…. He meant to kill the 
old woman when she was alone and he went there … and 
then Lizaveta came in … he killed her too.’
Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one 
another.
‘You can’t guess, then?’ he asked suddenly, feeling as 
though he were flinging himself down from a steeple.
‘N-no …’ whispered Sonia.
‘Take a good look.’
As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar 
sensation froze his heart. He looked at her and all at once 
seemed to see in her face the face of Lizaveta. He remem-
 Crime and Punishment
576
bered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s face, when he 
approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the 
wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, 
looking as little children do when they begin to be fright-
ened of something, looking intently and uneasily at what 
frightens them, shrinking back and holding out their little 
hands on the point of crying. Almost the same thing hap-
pened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the 
same terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly 
putting out her left hand, pressed her fingers faintly against 
his breast and slowly began to get up from the bed, mov-
ing further from him and keeping her eyes fixed even more 
immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear 
showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her 
and almost with the same childish smile.
‘Have you guessed?’ he whispered at last.
‘Good God!’ broke in an awful wail from her bosom.
She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pil-
lows, but a moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, 
seized both his hands and, gripping them tight in her thin 
fingers, began looking into his face again with the same in-
tent stare. In this last desperate look she tried to look into 
him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope; there 
was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, 
when she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and 
wondered why she had seen at once that there was no doubt. 
She could not have said, for instance, that she had foreseen 
something of the sort—and yet now, as soon as he told her, 
she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very 
 577thing.
‘Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,’ he begged her 
miserably.
It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of tell-
ing her, but this is how it happened.
She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was do-
ing, and, wringing her hands, walked into the middle of the 
room; but quickly went back and sat down again beside him, 
her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden she start-
ed as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on 
her knees before him, she did not know why.
‘What have you done—what have you done to yourself?’ 
she said in despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on 
his neck, threw her arms round him, and held him tightly.
Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mourn-
ful smile.
‘You are a strange girl, Sonia—you kiss me and hug me 
when I tell you about that…. You don’t think what you are 
doing.’
‘There is no one—no one in the whole world now so un-
happy as you!’ she cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he 
said, and she suddenly broke into violent hysterical weep-
ing.
A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and 
softened it at once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears 
started into his eyes and hung on his eyelashes.
‘Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?’ he said, looking at her 
almost with hope.
‘No, no, never, nowhere!’ cried Sonia. ‘I will follow you, I 
 Crime and Punishment
578
will follow you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how misera-
ble I am! … Why, why didn’t I know you before! Why didn’t 
you come before? Oh, dear!’
‘Here I have come.’
‘Yes, now! What’s to be done now? … Together, together!’ 
she repeated as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him 
again. ‘I’ll follow you to Siberia!’
He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty 
smile came to his lips.
‘Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,’ he said.
Sonia looked at him quickly.
Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy 
for the unhappy man the terrible idea of the murder over-
whelmed her. In his changed tone she seemed to hear the 
murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She 
knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. 
Now all these questions rushed at once into her mind. And 
again she could not believe it: ‘He, he is a murderer! Could 
it be true?’
‘What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?’ she said in com-
plete bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. 
‘How could you, you, a man like you…. How could you 
bring yourself to it? … What does it mean?’
‘Oh, well—to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,’ he answered 
wearily, almost with vexation.
Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she 
cried:
‘You were hungry! It was … to help your mother? Yes?’
‘No, Sonia, no,’ he muttered, turning away and hanging 
 579his head. ‘I was not so hungry…. I certainly did want to help 
my mother, but … that’s not the real thing either…. Don’t 
torture me, Sonia.’
Sonia clasped her hands.
‘Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! 
Who could believe it? And how could you give away your 
last farthing and yet rob and murder! Ah,’ she cried sud-
denly, ‘that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna … that 
money…. Can that money …’
‘No, Sonia,’ he broke in hurriedly, ‘that money was not 
it. Don’t worry yourself! That money my mother sent me 
and it came when I was ill, the day I gave it to you…. Ra-
zumihin saw it … he received it for me…. That money was 
mine—my own.’
Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her ut-
most to comprehend.
‘And that money…. I don’t even know really whether 
there was any money,’ he added softly, as though reflect-
ing. ‘I took a purse off her neck, made of chamois leather … 
a purse stuffed full of something … but I didn’t look in it; I 
suppose I hadn’t time…. And the things—chains and trin-
kets—I buried under a stone with the purse next morning 
in a yard off the V—— Prospect. They are all there now…. .’
Sonia strained every nerve to listen.
‘Then why … why, you said you did it to rob, but you took 
nothing?’ she asked quickly, catching at a straw.
‘I don’t know…. I haven’t yet decided whether to take that 
money or not,’ he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake 
up with a start, he gave a brief ironical smile. ‘Ach, what silly 
 Crime and Punishment
580
stuff I am talking, eh?’
The thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he 
mad? But she dismissed it at once. ‘No, it was something 
else.’ She could make nothing of it, nothing.
‘Do you know, Sonia,’ he said suddenly with conviction, 
‘let me tell you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,’ 
laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but 
sincerely at her, ‘I should be happy now. You must believe 
that! What would it matter to you,’ he cried a moment later 
with a sort of despair, ‘what would it matter to you if I were 
to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such a stu-
pid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to 
you to-day?’
Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.
‘I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all 
I have left.’
‘Go where?’ asked Sonia timidly.
‘Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,’ he 
smiled bitterly. ‘We are so different…. And you know, So-
nia, it’s only now, only this moment that I understand where 
I asked you to go with me yesterday! Yesterday when I said 
it I did not know where. I asked you for one thing, I came 
to you for one thing—not to leave me. You won’t leave me, 
Sonia?’
She squeezed his hand.
‘And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?’ 
he cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite 
anguish at her. ‘Here you expect an explanation from me, 
Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see that. But what 
 581can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer 
misery … on my account! Well, you are crying and embrac-
ing me again. Why do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my 
burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer 
too, and I shall feel better! And can you love such a mean 
wretch?’
‘But aren’t you suffering, too?’ cried Sonia.
Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, 
and again for an instant softened it.
‘Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may ex-
plain a great deal. I have come because I am bad. There are 
men who wouldn’t have come. But I am a coward and … 
a mean wretch. But … never mind! That’s not the point. I 
must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.’
He paused and sank into thought.
‘Ach, we are so different,’ he cried again, ‘we are not alike. 
And why, why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.’
‘No, no, it was a good thing you came,’ cried Sonia. ‘It’s 
better I should know, far better!’
He looked at her with anguish.
‘What if it were really that?’ he said, as though reaching 
a conclusion. ‘Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become 
a Napoleon, that is why I killed her…. Do you understand 
now?’
‘N-no,’ Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. ‘Only speak, 
speak, I shall understand, I shall understand in myself!’ she 
kept begging him.
‘You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!’ He paused 
and was for some time lost in meditation.

‘It was like this: I asked myself one day this question—
what if Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my 
place, and if he had not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the pas-
sage of Mont Blanc to begin his career with, but instead of 
all those picturesque and monumental things, there had 
simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who 
had to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for 
his career, you understand). Well, would he have brought 
himself to that if there had been no other means? Wouldn’t 
he have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and 
… and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I worried myself 
fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully ashamed 
when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it 
would not have given him the least pang, that it would not 
even have struck him that it was not monumental … that he 
would not have seen that there was anything in it to pause 
over, and that, if he had had no other way, he would have 
strangled her in a minute without thinking about it! Well, I 
too … left off thinking about it … murdered her, following 
his example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it 
funny? Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps 
that’s just how it was.’
Sonia did not think it at all funny.
‘You had better tell me straight out … without examples,’ 
she begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly.
He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her 
hands.
‘You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, 
it’s almost all talk! You see, you know of course that my 
 583mother has scarcely anything, my sister happened to have 
a good education and was condemned to drudge as a gov-
erness. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a student, 
but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced 
for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in 
ten or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some 
sort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand rou-
bles’ (he repeated it as though it were a lesson) ‘and by that 
time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety 
and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while 
my sister … well, my sister might well have fared worse! 
And it’s a hard thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to 
turn one’s back upon everything, to forget one’s mother and 
decorously accept the insults inflicted on one’s sister. Why 
should one? When one has buried them to burden oneself 
with others—wife and children—and to leave them again 
without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the 
old woman’s money and to use it for my first years with-
out worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university 
and for a little while after leaving it—and to do this all on 
a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new 
career and enter upon a new life of independence…. Well … 
that’s all…. Well, of course in killing the old woman I did 
wrong…. Well, that’s enough.’
He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and 
let his head sink.
‘Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,’ Sonia cried in distress. 
‘How could one … no, that’s not right, not right.’
‘You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly, 
 Crime and Punishment
584
it’s the truth.’
‘As though that could be the truth! Good God!’
‘I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, 
harmful creature.’
‘A human being—a louse!’
‘I too know it wasn’t a louse,’ he answered, looking 
strangely at her. ‘But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,’ he add-
ed. ‘I’ve been talking nonsense a long time…. That’s not it, 
you are right there. There were quite, quite other causes for 
it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so long, Sonia…. My head 
aches dreadfully now.’
His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost 
delirious; an uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible 
exhaustion could be seen through his excitement. Sonia 
saw how he was suffering. She too was growing dizzy. And 
he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow comprehensible, 
but yet … ‘But how, how! Good God!’ And she wrung her 
hands in despair.
‘No, Sonia, that’s not it,’ he began again suddenly, rais-
ing his head, as though a new and sudden train of thought 
had struck and as it were roused him—‘that’s not it! Bet-
ter … imagine—yes, it’s certainly better—imagine that I 
am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive and … well, 
perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out at 
once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told 
you just now I could not keep myself at the university. But 
do you know that perhaps I might have done? My mother 
would have sent me what I needed for the fees and I could 
have earned enough for clothes, boots and food, no doubt. 
 585Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! 
But I turned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the 
right word for it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been 
in my den, you’ve seen it…. And do you know, Sonia, that 
low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind? 
Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t go out of it! 
I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together, and 
I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing 
nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she 
didn’t, I went all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, 
from sulkiness! At night I had no light, I lay in the dark and 
I wouldn’t earn money for candles. I ought to have stud-
ied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies an inch thick on 
the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and think-
ing. And I kept thinking…. And I had dreams all the time, 
strange dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then 
I began to fancy that … No, that’s not it! Again I am tell-
ing you wrong! You see I kept asking myself then: why am 
I so stupid that if others are stupid—and I know they are—
yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one waits for 
everyone to get wiser it will take too long…. Afterwards I 
understood that that would never come to pass, that men 
won’t change and that nobody can alter it and that it’s not 
worth wasting effort over it. Yes, that’s so. That’s the law of 
their nature, Sonia, … that’s so! … And I know now, Sonia, 
that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will have power 
over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their 
eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among 
them and he who dares most of all will be most in the right! 
 Crime and Punishment
586
So it has been till now and so it will always be. A man must 
be blind not to see it!’
Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he 
no longer cared whether she understood or not. The fever 
had complete hold of him; he was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy 
(he certainly had been too long without talking to anyone). 
Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his faith and 
code.
‘I divined then, Sonia,’ he went on eagerly, ‘that power is 
only vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it 
up. There is only one thing, one thing needful: one has only 
to dare! Then for the first time in my life an idea took shape 
in my mind which no one had ever thought of before me, no 
one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is that not a single 
person living in this mad world has had the daring to go 
straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I … I wanted 
to have the daring … and I killed her. I only wanted to have 
the daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!’
‘Oh hush, hush,’ cried Sonia, clasping her hands. ‘You 
turned away from God and God has smitten you, has given 
you over to the devil!’
‘Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all 
this became clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, 
eh?’
‘Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand, 
you don’t understand! Oh God! He won’t understand!’
‘Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it 
was the devil leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!’ he repeat-
ed with gloomy insistence. ‘I know it all, I have thought it 
 587all over and over and whispered it all over to myself, lying 
there in the dark…. I’ve argued it all over with myself, every 
point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how sick I 
was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget 
it and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off think-
ing. And you don’t suppose that I went into it headlong like 
a fool? I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my 
destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that I didn’t know, 
for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I 
had the right to gain power—I certainly hadn’t the right—
or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse 
it proved that it wasn’t so for me, though it might be for 
a man who would go straight to his goal without asking 
questions…. If I worried myself all those days, wondering 
whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of 
course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony 
of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I 
wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own 
sake, for myself alone! I didn’t want to lie about it even to 
myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did the murder—that’s 
nonsense —I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and power 
and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I sim-
ply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and 
whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life 
like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life 
out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that moment…. And it 
was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It was not 
so much the money I wanted, but something else…. I know 
it all now…. Understand me! Perhaps I should never have 
 Crime and Punishment
588
committed a murder again. I wanted to find out something 
else; it was something else led me on. I wanted to find out 
then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else 
or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I 
dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling crea-
ture or whether I have the right …’
‘To kill? Have the right to kill?’ Sonia clasped her hands.
‘Ach, Sonia!’ he cried irritably and seemed about to make 
some retort, but was contemptuously silent. ‘Don’t interrupt 
me, Sonia. I want to prove one thing only, that the devil led 
me on then and he has shown me since that I had not the 
right to take that path, because I am just such a louse as 
all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you 
now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I 
have come to you? Listen: when I went then to the old wom-
an’s I only went to try…. You may be sure of that!’
‘And you murdered her!’
‘But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? 
Do men go to commit a murder as I went then? I will tell 
you some day how I went! Did I murder the old woman? I 
murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself once for all, for 
ever…. But it was the devil that killed that old woman, not 
I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!’ he cried in a 
sudden spasm of agony, ‘let me be!’
He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head 
in his hands as in a vise.
‘What suffering!’ A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.
‘Well, what am I to do now?’ he asked, suddenly raising 
his head and looking at her with a face hideously distorted 
 589by despair.
‘What are you to do?’ she cried, jumping up, and her eyes 
that had been full of tears suddenly began to shine. ‘Stand 
up!’ (She seized him by the shoulder, he got up, looking at 
her almost bewildered.) ‘Go at once, this very minute, stand 
at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the earth which you 
have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say to 
all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you 
life again. Will you go, will you go?’ she asked him, trem-
bling all over, snatching his two hands, squeezing them 
tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes full of fire.
He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.
‘You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?’ he 
asked gloomily.
‘Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must 
do.’
‘No! I am not going to them, Sonia!’
‘But how will you go on living? What will you live for?’ 
cried Sonia, ‘how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk 
to your mother? (Oh, what will become of them now?) But 
what am I saying? You have abandoned your mother and 
your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh, 
God!’ she cried, ‘why, he knows it all himself. How, how can 
he live by himself! What will become of you now?’
‘Don’t be a child, Sonia,’ he said softly. ‘What wrong 
have I done them? Why should I go to them? What should 
I say to them? That’s only a phantom…. They destroy men 
by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are 
knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them. And 
 Crime and Punishment
590
what should I say to them—that I murdered her, but did 
not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?’ he 
added with a bitter smile. ‘Why, they would laugh at me, 
and would call me a fool for not getting it. A coward and a 
fool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve to 
understand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a 
child, Sonia….’
‘It will be too much for you to bear, too much!’ she re-
peated, holding out her hands in despairing supplication.
‘Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,’ he observed gloom-
ily, pondering, ‘perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse 
and I’ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself. I’ll 
make another fight for it.’
A haughty smile appeared on his lips.
‘What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole 
life!’
‘I shall get used to it,’ he said grimly and thoughtfully. 
‘Listen,’ he began a minute later, ‘stop crying, it’s time to talk 
of the facts: I’ve come to tell you that the police are after me, 
on my track….’
‘Ach!’ Sonia cried in terror.
‘Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Sibe-
ria and now you are frightened? But let me tell you: I shall 
not give myself up. I shall make a struggle for it and they 
won’t do anything to me. They’ve no real evidence. Yester-
day I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day 
things are going better. All the facts they know can be ex-
plained two ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations 
to my credit, do you understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt 
 591my lesson. But they will certainly arrest me. If it had not 
been for something that happened, they would have done so 
to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-
day…. But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out again … 
for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be, 
I give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on 
what they have against me. Enough…. I only tell you that 
you may know…. I will try to manage somehow to put it to 
my mother and sister so that they won’t be frightened…. My 
sister’s future is secure, however, now, I believe … and my 
mother’s must be too…. Well, that’s all. Be careful, though. 
Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?’
‘Oh, I will, I will.’
They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as 
though they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some 
deserted shore. He looked at Sonia and felt how great was 
her love for him, and strange to say he felt it suddenly bur-
densome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a strange 
and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that 
all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least 
part of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned 
towards him, he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably 
unhappier than before.
‘Sonia,’ he said, ‘you’d better not come and see me when 
I am in prison.’
Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes 
passed.
‘Have you a cross on you?’ she asked, as though suddenly 
thinking of it.
 Crime and Punishment
592
He did not at first understand the question.
‘No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. 
I have another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I 
changed with Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her 
my little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. 
Take it … it’s mine! It’s mine, you know,’ she begged him. 
‘We will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our 
cross!’
‘Give it me,’ said Raskolnikov.
He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he 
drew back the hand he held out for the cross.
‘Not now, Sonia. Better later,’ he added to comfort her.
‘Yes, yes, better,’ she repeated with conviction, ‘when you 
go to meet your suffering, then put it on. You will come to 
me, I’ll put it on you, we will pray and go together.’
At that moment someone knocked three times at the 
door.
‘Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?’ they heard in a very 
familiar and polite voice.
Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of 
Mr. Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.
 593

## Chapter 5

L
ebeziatnikov looked perturbed.
‘I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,’ he began. ‘Ex-
cuse me … I thought I should find you,’ he said, addressing 
Raskolnikov suddenly, ‘that is, I didn’t mean anything … of 
that sort … But I just thought … Katerina Ivanovna has 
gone out of her mind,’ he blurted out suddenly, turning 
from Raskolnikov to Sonia.
Sonia screamed.
‘At least it seems so. But … we don’t know what to do, 
you see! She came back—she seems to have been turned out 
somewhere, perhaps beaten…. So it seems at least, … She 
had run to your father’s former chief, she didn’t find him at 
home: he was dining at some other general’s…. Only fancy, 
she rushed off there, to the other general’s, and, imagine, she 
was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her, 
had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine 
what happened. She was turned out, of course; but, accord-
ing to her own story, she abused him and threw something 
at him. One may well believe it…. How it is she wasn’t taken 
up, I can’t understand! Now she is telling everyone, includ-
ing Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to understand her, 
she is screaming and flinging herself about…. Oh yes, she 
shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take 
the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and 
 Crime and Punishment
594
the children will sing and dance, and she too, and collect 
money, and will go every day under the general’s window 
… ‘to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was 
an official, begging in the street.’ She keeps beating the chil-
dren and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida to sing ‘My 
Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing 
up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; 
she means to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of 
music…. She won’t listen to anything…. Imagine the state 
of things! It’s beyond anything!’
Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had 
heard him almost breathless, snatched up her cloak and 
hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her things as she 
went. Raskolnikov followed her and Lebeziatnikov came af-
ter him.
‘She has certainly gone mad!’ he said to Raskolnikov, as 
they went out into the street. ‘I didn’t want to frighten So-
fya Semyonovna, so I said ‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t 
a doubt of it. They say that in consumption the tubercles 
sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I know nothing of 
medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t listen.’
‘Did you talk to her about the tubercles?’
‘Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have 
understood! But what I say is, that if you convince a person 
logically that he has nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. 
That’s clear. Is it your conviction that he won’t?’
‘Life would be too easy if it were so,’ answered Raskol-
nikov.
‘Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather dif-
 595ficult for Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you 
know that in Paris they have been conducting serious ex-
periments as to the possibility of curing the insane, simply 
by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific man 
of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such 
treatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong 
with the physical organism of the insane, and that insan-
ity is, so to say, a logical mistake, an error of judgment, an 
incorrect view of things. He gradually showed the madman 
his error and, would you believe it, they say he was success-
ful? But as he made use of douches too, how far success was 
due to that treatment remains uncertain…. So it seems at 
least.’
Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the 
house where he lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went 
in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov woke up with a start, looked 
about him and hurried on.
Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in 
the middle of it. Why had he come back here? He looked 
at the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his sofa…. 
From the yard came a loud continuous knocking; someone 
seemed to be hammering … He went to the window, rose 
on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with 
an air of absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and 
he could not see who was hammering. In the house on the 
left he saw some open windows; on the window-sills were 
pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out of 
the windows … He knew it all by heart. He turned away 
and sat down on the sofa.
 Crime and Punishment
596
Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!
Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to 
hate Sonia, now that he had made her more miserable.
‘Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need 
had he to poison her life? Oh, the meanness of it!’
‘I will remain alone,’ he said resolutely, ‘and she shall not 
come to the prison!’
Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. 
That was a strange thought.
‘Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,’ he thought 
suddenly.
He could not have said how long he sat there with vague 
thoughts surging through his mind. All at once the door 
opened and Dounia came in. At first she stood still and 
looked at him from the doorway, just as he had done at So-
nia; then she came in and sat down in the same place as 
yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and 
almost vacantly at her.
‘Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,’ 
said Dounia.
Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were 
bright and soft. He saw that she too had come to him with 
love.
‘Brother, now I know all, all. Dmitri Prokofitch has ex-
plained and told me everything. They are worrying and 
persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspi-
cion…. Dmitri Prokofitch told me that there is no danger, 
and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror. 
I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you 
 597must be, and that that indignation may have a permanent 
effect on you. That’s what I am afraid of. As for your cutting 
yourself off from us, I don’t judge you, I don’t venture to 
judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it. I feel 
that I too, if I had so great a trouble, should keep away from 
everyone. I shall tell mother nothing of this but I shall talk 
about you continually and shall tell her from you that you 
will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; I will set her 
mind at rest; but don’t you try her too much—come once 
at least; remember that she is your mother. And now I have 
come simply to say’ (Dounia began to get up) ‘that if you 
should need me or should need … all my life or anything … 
call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!’
She turned abruptly and went towards the door.
‘Dounia!’ Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. 
‘That Razumihin, Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.’
Dounia flushed slightly.
‘Well?’ she asked, waiting a moment.
‘He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of 
real love…. Good-bye, Dounia.’
Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.
‘But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for 
ever that you … give me such a parting message?’
‘Never mind…. Good-bye.’
He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a 
moment, looked at him uneasily, and went out troubled.
No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very 
last one) when he had longed to take her in his arms and say 
good-bye to her, and even to tell her, but he had not dared 
 Crime and Punishment
598
even to touch her hand.
‘Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I 
embraced her, and will feel that I stole her kiss.’
‘And would she stand that test?’ he went on a few minutes 
later to himself. ‘No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand 
things! They never do.’
And he thought of Sonia.
There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The 
daylight was fading. He took up his cap and went out.
He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill 
he was. But all this continual anxiety and agony of mind 
could not but affect him. And if he were not lying in high 
fever it was perhaps just because this continual inner strain 
helped to keep him on his legs and in possession of his fac-
ulties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.
He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special 
form of misery had begun to oppress him of late. There was 
nothing poignant, nothing acute about it; but there was a 
feeling of permanence, of eternity about it; it brought a fore-
taste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a foretaste 
of an eternity ‘on a square yard of space.’ Towards evening 
this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.
‘With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending 
on the sunset or something, one can’t help doing something 
stupid! You’ll go to Dounia, as well as to Sonia,’ he muttered 
bitterly.
He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziat-
nikov rushed up to him.
‘Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only 
 599fancy, she’s carried out her plan, and taken away the chil-
dren. Sofya Semyonovna and I have had a job to find them. 
She is rapping on a frying-pan and making the children 
dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the 
cross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools 
running after them. Come along!’
‘And Sonia?’ Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after 
Lebeziatnikov.
‘Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s 
frantic, but Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s 
frantic too. But Katerina Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell 
you she is quite mad. They’ll be taken to the police. You can 
fancy what an effect that will have…. They are on the canal 
bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya Semyonov-
na’s, quite close.’
On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses 
away from the one where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of 
people, consisting principally of gutter children. The hoarse 
broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could be heard from the 
bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle likely to at-
tract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with 
the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hid-
eous way on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted 
and breathless. Her wasted consumptive face looked more 
suffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine 
a consumptive always looks worse than at home. But her ex-
citement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew 
more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, 
coaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and 
 Crime and Punishment
600
what to sing, began explaining to them why it was neces-
sary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, 
beat them…. Then she would make a rush at the crowd; if 
she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, 
she immediately appealed to him to see what these children 
‘from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house’ had been 
brought to. If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, 
she would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling 
with them. Some people laughed, others shook their heads, 
but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman 
with the frightened children. The frying-pan of which Le-
beziatnikov had spoken was not there, at least Raskolnikov 
did not see it. But instead of rapping on the pan, Katerina 
Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands, when she made 
Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in 
the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fear-
ful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed 
tears. What made her most furious was the weeping and ter-
ror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had been made to dress 
the children up as street singers are dressed. The boy had 
on a turban made of something red and white to look like a 
Turk. There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a 
red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to 
Marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich 
feather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna’s grandmother’s 
and had been preserved as a family possession. Polenka was 
in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her 
mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly 
realised her mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about 
 601her. She was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd. 
Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna, weeping and beseech-
ing her to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was not to 
be persuaded.
‘Leave off, Sonia, leave off,’ she shouted, speaking fast, 
panting and coughing. ‘You don’t know what you ask; you 
are like a child! I’ve told you before that I am not coming 
back to that drunken German. Let everyone, let all Pe-
tersburg see the children begging in the streets, though 
their father was an honourable man who served all his life 
in truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.’ 
(Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story 
and thoroughly believed it.) ‘Let that wretch of a general see 
it! And you are silly, Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. 
We have worried you enough, I won’t go on so! Ah, Rodi-
on Romanovitch, is that you?’ she cried, seeing Raskolnikov 
and rushing up to him. ‘Explain to this silly girl, please, that 
nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn 
their living, and everyone will see at once that we are differ-
ent, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced 
to beggary. And that general will lose his post, you’ll see! 
We shall perform under his windows every day, and if the 
Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children before 
me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is 
the father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, 
you’ll see, and that wretch of a general…. Lida, tenez vous 
droite! Kolya, you’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? 
Whimpering again! What are you afraid of, stupid? Good-
ness, what am I to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch? If 
 Crime and Punishment
602
you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with 
such children?’
And she, almost crying herself—which did not stop her 
uninterrupted, rapid flow of talk—pointed to the crying 
children. Raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home, 
and even said, hoping to work on her vanity, that it was 
unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an 
organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the princi-
pal of a boarding-school.
‘A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,’ cried 
Katerina Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. ‘No, Ro-
dion Romanovitch, that dream is over! All have forsaken 
us! … And that general…. You know, Rodion Romanovitch, 
I threw an inkpot at him—it happened to be standing in 
the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. 
I wrote my name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the 
scoundrels, the scoundrels! But enough of them, now I’ll 
provide for the children myself, I won’t bow down to any-
body! She has had to bear enough for us!’ she pointed to 
Sonia. ‘Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, 
only two farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us 
nothing, only run after us, putting their tongues out. There, 
what is that blockhead laughing at?’ (She pointed to a man 
in the crowd.) ‘It’s all because Kolya here is so stupid; I have 
such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka? Tell 
me in French, parlez-moi français. Why, I’ve taught you, 
you know some phrases. Else how are you to show that you 
are of good family, well brought-up children, and not at all 
like other organ-grinders? We aren’t going to have a Punch 
 603and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel song…. Ah, 
yes, … What are we to sing? You keep putting me out, but 
we … you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, 
to find something to sing and get money, something Kolya 
can dance to…. For, as you can fancy, our performance is 
all impromptu…. We must talk it over and rehearse it all 
thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky, where there are 
far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed at 
once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ 
and everyone sings that. We must sing something far more 
genteel…. Well, have you thought of anything, Polenka? If 
only you’d help your mother! My memory’s quite gone, or I 
should have thought of something. We really can’t sing ‘An 
Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have taught 
it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people 
will see at once that you are children of good family, and 
that will be much more touching…. You might sing ‘Marl-
borough s’en va-t-en guerre,’ for that’s quite a child’s song 
and is sung as a lullaby in all the aristocratic houses.
‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra 
…’
she began singing. ‘But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, 
Kolya, your hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, 
keep turning the other way, and Polenka and I will sing and 
clap our hands!
‘Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage.’
(Cough-cough-cough!) ‘Set your dress straight, Polenka, 
it’s slipped down on your shoulders,’ she observed, panting 
from coughing. ‘Now it’s particularly necessary to behave 
 Crime and Punishment
604
nicely and genteelly, that all may see that you are well-born 
children. I said at the time that the bodice should be cut 
longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia, 
with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the 
child is quite deformed by it…. Why, you’re all crying again! 
What’s the matter, stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, 
make haste! Oh, what an unbearable child!
‘Cinq sous, cinq sous.
‘A policeman again! What do you want?’
A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the 
crowd. But at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform 
and an overcoat—a solid- looking official of about fifty with 
a decoration on his neck (which delighted Katerina Ivanov-
na and had its effect on the policeman)— approached and 
without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His 
face wore a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna 
took it and gave him a polite, even ceremonious, bow.
‘I thank you, honoured sir,’ she began loftily. ‘The causes 
that have induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there 
are generous and honourable people who are ready to help a 
poor gentlewoman in distress). You see, honoured sir, these 
orphans of good family—I might even say of aristocratic 
connections—and that wretch of a general sat eating grouse 
… and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I 
said, ‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, 
Semyon Zaharovitch, and on the very day of his death the 
basest of scoundrels slandered his only daughter.’ … That 
policeman again! Protect me,’ she cried to the official. ‘Why 
is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run 
 605away from one of them. What do you want, fool?’
‘It’s forbidden in the streets. You mustn’t make a distur-
bance.’
‘It’s you’re making a disturbance. It’s just the same as if I 
were grinding an organ. What business is it of yours?’
‘You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t 
got one, and in that way you collect a crowd. Where do you 
lodge?’
‘What, a license?’ wailed Katerina Ivanovna. ‘I buried my 
husband to-day. What need of a license?’
‘Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,’ began the official. 
‘Come along; I will escort you…. This is no place for you in 
the crowd. You are ill.’
‘Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,’ screamed 
Katerina Ivanovna. ‘We are going to the Nevsky…. Sonia, 
Sonia! Where is she? She is crying too! What’s the matter 
with you all? Kolya, Lida, where are you going?’ she cried 
suddenly in alarm. ‘Oh, silly children! Kolya, Lida, where 
are they off to? …’
Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, 
and their mother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each oth-
er by the hand, and ran off at the sight of the policeman 
who wanted to take them away somewhere. Weeping and 
wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was 
a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and 
panting for breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.
‘Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, 
ungrateful children! … Polenka! catch them…. It’s for your 
sakes I …’
 Crime and Punishment
606
She stumbled as she ran and fell down.
‘She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding! Oh, dear!’ cried Sonia, 
bending over her.
All ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Leb-
eziatnikov were the first at her side, the official too hastened 
up, and behind him the policeman who muttered, ‘Bother!’ 
with a gesture of impatience, feeling that the job was going 
to be a troublesome one.
‘Pass on! Pass on!’ he said to the crowd that pressed for-
ward.
‘She’s dying,’ someone shouted.
‘She’s gone out of her mind,’ said another.
‘Lord have mercy upon us,’ said a woman, crossing her-
self. ‘Have they caught the little girl and the boy? They’re 
being brought back, the elder one’s got them…. Ah, the 
naughty imps!’
When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they 
saw that she had not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia 
thought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red 
was from her chest.
‘I’ve seen that before,’ muttered the official to Raskol-
nikov and Lebeziatnikov; ‘that’s consumption; the blood 
flows and chokes the patient. I saw the same thing with a 
relative of my own not long ago … nearly a pint of blood, all 
in a minute…. What’s to be done though? She is dying.’
‘This way, this way, to my room!’ Sonia implored. ‘I live 
here! … See, that house, the second from here…. Come to 
me, make haste,’ she turned from one to the other. ‘Send for 
the doctor! Oh, dear!’
 607Thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the 
policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She 
was carried to Sonia’s room, almost unconscious, and laid 
on the bed. The blood was still flowing, but she seemed to 
be coming to herself. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the 
official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed 
by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which fol-
lowed to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and 
Lida, who were trembling and weeping. Several persons 
came in too from the Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, 
a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whis-
kers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman 
with an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-
mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these, 
Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov 
looked at him with surprise, not understanding where he 
had come from and not having noticed him in the crowd. 
A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The official whispered 
to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now for the 
doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran 
himself.
Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. 
The bleeding ceased for a time. She looked with sick but 
intent and penetrating eyes at Sonia, who stood pale and 
trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with a handker-
chief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the 
bed, supporting her on both sides.
‘Where are the children?’ she said in a faint voice. ‘You’ve 
brought them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run 
 Crime and Punishment
608
away…. Och!’
Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. 
She moved her eyes, looking about her.
‘So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in 
your room.’
She looked at her with a face of suffering.
‘We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, 
come here! Well, here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand 
them over to you, I’ve had enough! The ball is over.’ (Cough!) 
‘Lay me down, let me die in peace.’
They laid her back on the pillow.
‘What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a 
rouble to spare. I have no sins. God must forgive me with-
out that. He knows how I have suffered…. And if He won’t 
forgive me, I don’t care!’
She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times 
she shuddered, turned her eyes from side to side, recog-
nised everyone for a minute, but at once sank into delirium 
again. Her breathing was hoarse and difficult, there was a 
sort of rattle in her throat.
‘I said to him, your excellency,’ she ejaculated, gasping 
after each word. ‘That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, 
hands on your hips, make haste! Glissez, glissez! pas de 
basque! Tap with your heels, be a graceful child!
‘Du hast Diamanten und Perlen
‘What next? That’s the thing to sing.
‘Du hast die schonsten Augen Madchen, was willst du 
mehr?
‘What an idea! Was willst du mehr? What things the fool 
 609invents! Ah, yes!
‘In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.
‘Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Po-
lenka! Your father, you know, used to sing it when we were 
engaged…. Oh those days! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! 
How does it go? I’ve forgotten. Remind me! How was it?’
She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in 
a horribly hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and 
gasping at every word, with a look of growing terror.
‘In the heat of midday! … in the vale! … of Dagestan! … 
With lead in my breast! …’
‘Your excellency!’ she wailed suddenly with a heart-rend-
ing scream and a flood of tears, ‘protect the orphans! You 
have been their father’s guest … one may say aristocratic….’ 
She started, regaining consciousness, and gazed at all with 
a sort of terror, but at once recognised Sonia.
‘Sonia, Sonia!’ she articulated softly and caressingly, as 
though surprised to find her there. ‘Sonia darling, are you 
here, too?’
They lifted her up again.
‘Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I 
am broken!’ she cried with vindictive despair, and her head 
fell heavily back on the pillow.
She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did 
not last long. Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, 
her mouth fell open, her leg moved convulsively, she gave a 
deep, deep sigh and died.
Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and re-
mained motionless with her head pressed to the dead

610
woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw herself at her moth-
er’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though Kolya 
and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had 
a feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands 
on each other’s little shoulders, stared straight at one an-
other and both at once opened their mouths and began 
screaming. They were both still in their fancy dress; one in 
a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.
And how did ‘the certificate of merit’ come to be on the 
bed beside Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; 
Raskolnikov saw it.
He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped 
up to him.
‘She is dead,’ he said.
‘Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,’ 
said Svidrigaïlov, coming up to them.
Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately 
withdrew. Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.
‘I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and 
that. You know it’s a question of money and, as I told you, 
I have plenty to spare. I will put those two little ones and 
Polenka into some good orphan asylum, and I will settle 
fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of 
age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about 
them. And I will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a 
good girl, isn’t she? So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is 
how I am spending her ten thousand.’
‘What is your motive for such benevolence?’ asked Ras-
kolnikov.
 611‘Ah! you sceptical person!’ laughed Svidrigaïlov. ‘I told 
you I had no need of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s 
simply done from humanity? She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know’ 
(he pointed to the corner where the dead woman lay), ‘was 
she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll agree, 
is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is 
she to die? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the 
same way.’
He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, 
keeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white 
and cold, hearing his own phrases, spoken to Sonia. He 
quickly stepped back and looked wildly at Svidrigaïlov.
‘How do you know?’ he whispered, hardly able to 
breathe.
‘Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side 
of the wall. Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame 
Resslich, an old and devoted friend of mine. I am a neigh-
bour.’
‘You?’
‘Yes,’ continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. ‘I 
assure you on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that 
you have interested me enormously. I told you we should 
become friends, I foretold it. Well, here we have. And you 
will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll see 
that you can get on with me!’
