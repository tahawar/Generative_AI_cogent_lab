# Part III

## Chapter 1

R
askolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved 
his hand weakly to Razumihin to cut short the flow of 
warm and incoherent consolations he was addressing to his 
mother and sister, took them both by the hand and for a 
minute or two gazed from one to the other without speak-
ing. His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed 
an emotion agonisingly poignant, and at the same time 
something immovable, almost insane. Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna began to cry.
Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her 
brother’s.
‘Go home … with him,’ he said in a broken voice, point-
ing to Razumihin, ‘good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow 
everything … Is it long since you arrived?’
‘This evening, Rodya,’ answered Pulcheria Alexandrov-
na, ‘the train was awfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would 
induce me to leave you now! I will spend the night here, 
near you …’
‘Don’t torture me!’ he said with a gesture of irritation.
‘I will stay with him,’ cried Razumihin, ‘I won’t leave him 
for a moment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their 
hearts’ content! My uncle is presiding there.’
‘How, how can I thank you!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
was beginning, once more pressing Razumihin’s hands, but 
 281Raskolnikov interrupted her again.
‘I can’t have it! I can’t have it!’ he repeated irritably, ‘don’t 
worry me! Enough, go away … I can’t stand it!’
‘Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a min-
ute,’ Dounia whispered in dismay; ‘we are distressing him, 
that’s evident.’
‘Mayn’t I look at him after three years?’ wept Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna.
‘Stay,’ he stopped them again, ‘you keep interrupting me, 
and my ideas get muddled…. Have you seen Luzhin?’
‘No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have 
heard, Rodya, that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit 
you today,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna added somewhat tim-
idly.
‘Yes … he was so kind … Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d 
throw him downstairs and told him to go to hell….’
‘Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to 
tell us …’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she 
stopped, looking at Dounia.
Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her 
brother, waiting for what would come next. Both of them 
had heard of the quarrel from Nastasya, so far as she had 
succeeded in understanding and reporting it, and were in 
painful perplexity and suspense.
‘Dounia,’ Raskolnikov continued with an effort, ‘I don’t 
want that marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow 
you must refuse Luzhin, so that we may never hear his 
name again.’
‘Good Heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
 Crime and Punishment
282
‘Brother, think what you are saying!’ Avdotya Romanov-
na began impetuously, but immediately checked herself. 
‘You are not fit to talk now, perhaps; you are tired,’ she add-
ed gently.
‘You think I am delirious? No … You are marrying Lu-
zhin for my sake. But I won’t accept the sacrifice. And so 
write a letter before to-morrow, to refuse him … Let me 
read it in the morning and that will be the end of it!’
‘That I can’t do!’ the girl cried, offended, ‘what right have 
you …’
‘Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow … Don’t 
you see …’ the mother interposed in dismay. ‘Better come 
away!’
‘He is raving,’ Razumihin cried tipsily, ‘or how would he 
dare! To-morrow all this nonsense will be over … to-day he 
certainly did drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got 
angry, too…. He made speeches here, wanted to show off
 
his learning and he went out crest- fallen….’
‘Then it’s true?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
‘Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,’ said Dounia compas-
sionately—‘let us go, mother … Good-bye, Rodya.’
‘Do you hear, sister,’ he repeated after them, making a last 
effort, ‘I am not delirious; this marriage is—an infamy. Let 
me act like a scoundrel, but you mustn’t … one is enough … 
and though I am a scoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister. 
It’s me or Luzhin! Go now….’
‘But you’re out of your mind! Despot!’ roared Razumi-
hin; but Raskolnikov did not and perhaps could not answer. 
He lay down on the sofa, and turned to the wall, utterly 
 283exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with interest at 
Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively 
started at her glance.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.
‘Nothing would induce me to go,’ she whispered in de-
spair to Razumihin. ‘I will stay somewhere here … escort 
Dounia home.’
‘You’ll spoil everything,’ Razumihin answered in the 
same whisper, losing patience—‘come out on to the stairs, 
anyway. Nastasya, show a light! I assure you,’ he went on 
in a half whisper on the stairs- ‘that he was almost beat-
ing the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you understand? 
The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as 
not to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he 
dressed at once and slipped off. And he will slip off again if 
you irritate him, at this time of night, and will do himself 
some mischief….’
‘What are you saying?’
‘And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those 
lodgings without you. Just think where you are staying! That 
blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch couldn’t find you better lodg-
ings … But you know I’ve had a little to drink, and that’s 
what makes me … swear; don’t mind it….’
‘But I’ll go to the landlady here,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
insisted, ‘Ill beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and 
me for the night. I can’t leave him like that, I cannot!’
This conversation took place on the landing just before 
the landlady’s door. Nastasya lighted them from a step be-
low. Razumihin was in extraordinary excitement. Half an 
 Crime and Punishment
284
hour earlier, while he was bringing Raskolnikov home, he 
had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of it himself, 
and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he had 
imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all 
that he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled 
effect. He stood with the two ladies, seizing both by their 
hands, persuading them, and giving them reasons with as-
tonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he 
uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed 
their hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Ro-
manovna without the least regard for good manners. They 
sometimes pulled their hands out of his huge bony paws, 
but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew them all 
the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost 
from the staircase, he would have done it without thought 
or hesitation in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna felt that the young man was really too eccentric and 
pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety over her Rodya 
she looked on his presence as providential, and was un-
willing to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya 
Romanovna shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous 
disposition, she could not see the glowing light in his eyes 
without wonder and almost alarm. It was only the un-
bounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her 
brother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to 
run away from him, and to persuade her mother to do the 
same. She realised, too, that even running away was per-
haps impossible now. Ten minutes later, however, she was 
considerably reassured; it was characteristic of Razumihin 
 285that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he 
might be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they 
had to deal with.
‘You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!’ he 
cried. ‘If you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive 
him to a frenzy, and then goodness knows what will hap-
pen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll do: Nastasya will stay with 
him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you can’t be in 
the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that way…. 
But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter 
of an hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news 
how he is, whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! 
Then I’ll run home in a twinkling—I’ve a lot of friends there, 
all drunk—I’ll fetch Zossimov—that’s the doctor who is 
looking after him, he is there, too, but he is not drunk; he is 
not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him to Rodya, and 
then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the hour—from 
the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s 
a very different thing from my account of him! If there’s 
anything wrong, I swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if 
it’s all right, you go to bed. And I’ll spend the night here, in 
the passage, he won’t hear me, and I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep 
at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which is better for him: you 
or the doctor? So come home then! But the landlady is out of 
the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of the question 
for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s … for she’s a fool … 
She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and 
of you, too, if you want to know … of Avdotya Romanov-
na certainly. She is an absolutely, absolutely unaccountable 
 Crime and Punishment
286
character! But I am a fool, too! … No matter! Come along! 
Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?’
‘Let us go, mother,’ said Avdotya Romanovna, ‘he will 
certainly do what he has promised. He has saved Rodya 
already, and if the doctor really will consent to spend the 
night here, what could be better?’
‘You see, you … you … understand me, because you are 
an angel!’ Razumihin cried in ecstasy, ‘let us go! Nasta-
sya! Fly upstairs and sit with him with a light; I’ll come in a 
quarter of an hour.’
Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly con-
vinced, she made no further resistance. Razumihin gave an 
arm to each and drew them down the stairs. He still made 
her uneasy, as though he was competent and good-natured, 
was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in 
such a condition….
‘Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!’ Razumihin 
broke in upon her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled 
along the pavement with huge steps, so that the two ladies 
could hardly keep up with him, a fact he did not observe, 
however. ‘Nonsense! That is … I am drunk like a fool, but 
that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has 
turned my head … But don’t mind me! Don’t take any no-
tice: I am talking nonsense, I am not worthy of you…. I am 
utterly unworthy of you! The minute I’ve taken you home, 
I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over my head in the 
gutter here, and then I shall be all right…. If only you knew 
how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You 
may be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, 
 287and therefore I am your friend, too, I want to be … I had a 
presentiment … Last year there was a moment … though 
it wasn’t a presentiment really, for you seem to have fallen 
from heaven. And I expect I shan’t sleep all night … Zos-
simov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad … 
that’s why he mustn’t be irritated.’
‘What do you say?’ cried the mother.
‘Did the doctor really say that?’ asked Avdotya Romanov-
na, alarmed.
‘Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some med-
icine, a powder, I saw it, and then your coming here…. Ah! 
It would have been better if you had come to-morrow. It’s a 
good thing we went away. And in an hour Zossimov him-
self will report to you about everything. He is not drunk! 
And I shan’t be drunk…. And what made me get so tight? 
Because they got me into an argument, damn them! I’ve 
sworn never to argue! They talk such trash! I almost came 
to blows! I’ve left my uncle to preside. Would you believe, 
they insist on complete absence of individualism and that’s 
just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike 
themselves as they can. That’s what they regard as the high-
est point of progress. If only their nonsense were their own, 
but as it is …’
‘Listen!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, 
but it only added fuel to the flames.
‘What do you think?’ shouted Razumihin, louder than 
ever, ‘you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense? 
Not a bit! I like them to talk nonsense. That’s man’s one priv-
ilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! 
 Crime and Punishment
288
I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without 
making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and 
fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even 
make mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk 
your own nonsense, and I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in 
one’s own way is better than to go right in someone else’s. In 
the first case you are a man, in the second you’re no better 
than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life can be cramped. 
There have been examples. And what are we doing now? In 
science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, lib-
eralism, judgment, experience and everything, everything, 
everything, we are still in the preparatory class at school. 
We prefer to live on other people’s ideas, it’s what we are 
used to! Am I right, am I right?’ cried Razumihin, pressing 
and shaking the two ladies’ hands.
‘Oh, mercy, I do not know,’ cried poor Pulcheria Alex-
androvna.
‘Yes, yes … though I don’t agree with you in everything,’ 
added Avdotya Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a 
cry, for he squeezed her hand so painfully.
‘Yes, you say yes … well after that you … you …’ he cried 
in a transport, ‘you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense … 
and perfection. Give me your hand … you give me yours, 
too! I want to kiss your hands here at once, on my knees …’ 
and he fell on his knees on the pavement, fortunately at that 
time deserted.
‘Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?’ Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna cried, greatly distressed.
‘Get up, get up!’ said Dounia laughing, though she, too, 
 289was upset.
‘Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That’s 
it! Enough! I get up and we’ll go on! I am a luckless fool, I 
am unworthy of you and drunk … and I am ashamed…. I 
am not worthy to love you, but to do homage to you is the 
duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And I’ve done 
homage…. Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Ro-
dya was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away…. How 
dare he! how dare he put you in such lodgings! It’s a scan-
dal! Do you know the sort of people they take in here? And 
you his betrothed! You are his betrothed? Yes? Well, then, 
I’ll tell you, your fiancé is a scoundrel.’
‘Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting …’ Pul-
cheria Alexandrovna was beginning.
‘Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed 
of it,’ Razumihin made haste to apologise. ‘But … but you 
can’t be angry with me for speaking so! For I speak sincere-
ly and not because … hm, hm! That would be disgraceful; in 
fact not because I’m in … hm! Well, anyway, I won’t say why, 
I daren’t…. But we all saw to-day when he came in that that 
man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair curled at 
the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his 
wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-
flint and a buffoon. That’s evident. Do you think him clever? 
No, he is a fool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good 
heavens! Do you see, ladies?’ he stopped suddenly on the 
way upstairs to their rooms, ‘though all my friends there are 
drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we do talk a lot 
of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the truth 
 Crime and Punishment
290
at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch 
… is not on the right path. Though I’ve been calling them 
all sorts of names just now, I do respect them all … though 
I don’t respect Zametov, I like him, for he is a puppy, and 
that bullock Zossimov, because he is an honest man and 
knows his work. But enough, it’s all said and forgiven. Is it 
forgiven? Well, then, let’s go on. I know this corridor, I’ve 
been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3…. Where 
are you here? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves 
in for the night, then. Don’t let anybody in. In a quarter of 
an hour I’ll come back with news, and half an hour later I’ll 
bring Zossimov, you’ll see! Good- bye, I’ll run.’
‘Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?’ said 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with 
anxiety and dismay.
‘Don’t worry yourself, mother,’ said Dounia, taking off
 
her hat and cape. ‘God has sent this gentleman to our aid, 
though he has come from a drinking party. We can depend 
on him, I assure you. And all that he has done for Ro-
dya….’
‘Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! 
How could I bring myself to leave Rodya? … And how dif-
ferent, how different I had fancied our meeting! How sullen 
he was, as though not pleased to see us….’
Tears came into her eyes.
‘No, it’s not that, mother. You didn’t see, you were crying 
all the time. He is quite unhinged by serious illness—that’s 
the reason.’
‘Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? 
 291And how he talked to you, Dounia!’ said the mother, look-
ing timidly at her daughter, trying to read her thoughts 
and, already half consoled by Dounia’s standing up for her 
brother, which meant that she had already forgiven him. ‘I 
am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,’ she added, 
probing her further.
‘And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow … 
about that,’ Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, 
there was no going beyond that, for this was a point which 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss. Dounia went 
up and kissed her mother. The latter warmly embraced her 
without speaking. Then she sat down to wait anxiously for 
Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who 
walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in 
thought. This walking up and down when she was thinking 
was a habit of Avdotya Romanovna’s and the mother was 
always afraid to break in on her daughter’s mood at such 
moments.
Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden 
drunken infatuation for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart 
from his eccentric condition, many people would have 
thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya Romanov-
na, especially at that moment when she was walking to 
and fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Av-
dotya Romanovna was remarkably good looking; she was 
tall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant—
the latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though 
it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness 
of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but 
 Crime and Punishment
292
she might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was 
dark brown, a little lighter than her brother’s; there was 
a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a 
look of extraordinary kindness. She was pale, but it was 
a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness and 
vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip 
projected a little as did her chin; it was the only irregular-
ity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual 
and almost haughty expression. Her face was always more 
serious and thoughtful than gay; but how well smiles, how 
well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible, laughter suited 
her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open, simple-
hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen 
anyone like her and was not quite sober at the time, should 
lose his head immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, 
he saw Dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for 
her brother and her joy at meeting him. Afterwards he saw 
her lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother’s inso-
lent, cruel and ungrateful words—and his fate was sealed.
He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out 
in his drunken talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, 
Raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, would be jealous of Pul-
cheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotya Romanovna on 
his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-
three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she 
looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost 
always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, 
sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age. 
We may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the 
 293only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her hair had be-
gun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s 
foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and 
sunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome 
face. She was Dounia over again, twenty years older, but 
without the projecting underlip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, 
but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept 
a great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, 
but there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle 
and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce 
her to cross.
Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, 
there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he 
had come back.
‘I won’t come in, I haven’t time,’ he hastened to say when 
the door was opened. ‘He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, 
and God grant he may sleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; 
I told her not to leave till I came. Now I am fetching Zos-
simov, he will report to you and then you’d better turn in; I 
can see you are too tired to do anything….’
And he ran off down the corridor.
‘What a very competent and … devoted young man!’ 
cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.
‘He seems a splendid person!’ Avdotya Romanovna re-
plied with some warmth, resuming her walk up and down 
the room.
It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps 
in the corridor and another knock at the door. Both wom-
 Crime and Punishment
294
en waited this time completely relying on Razumihin’s 
promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing Zossimov. 
Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party 
to go to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with 
the greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razu-
mihin in his exhilarated condition. But his vanity was at 
once reassured and flattered; he saw that they were really 
expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten minutes and 
succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pul-
cheria Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but 
with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a young doctor 
at an important consultation. He did not utter a word on 
any other subject and did not display the slightest desire to 
enter into more personal relations with the two ladies. Re-
marking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya 
Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during 
his visit and addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna. All this gave him extraordinary inward satisfaction. 
He declared that he thought the invalid at this moment go-
ing on very satisfactorily. According to his observations the 
patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material 
surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly 
also a moral origin, ‘was, so to speak, the product of sever-
al material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, 
troubles, certain ideas … and so on.’ Noticing stealthily that 
Avdotya Romanovna was following his words with close at-
tention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme. 
On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly in-
quiring as to ‘some suspicion of insanity,’ he replied with 
 295a composed and candid smile that his words had been ex-
aggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, 
something approaching a monomania—he, Zossimov, was 
now particularly studying this interesting branch of medi-
cine—but that it must be recollected that until to-day the 
patient had been in delirium and … and that no doubt the 
presence of his family would have a favourable effect on his 
recovery and distract his mind, ‘if only all fresh shocks can 
be avoided,’ he added significantly. Then he got up, took 
leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, 
warm gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, 
and Avdotya Romanovna spontaneously offered her hand 
to him. He went out exceedingly pleased with his visit and 
still more so with himself.
‘We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!’ Razumihin 
said in conclusion, following Zossimov out. ‘I’ll be with you 
to-morrow morning as early as possible with my report.’
‘That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,’ re-
marked Zossimov, almost licking his lips as they both came 
out into the street.
‘Fetching? You said fetching?’ roared Razumihin and he 
flew at Zossimov and seized him by the throat. ‘If you ever 
dare…. Do you understand? Do you understand?’ he shout-
ed, shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against 
the wall. ‘Do you hear?’
‘Let me go, you drunken devil,’ said Zossimov, strug-
gling and when he had let him go, he stared at him and went 
off into a sudden guffaw. Razumihin stood facing him in 
gloomy and earnest reflection.
 Crime and Punishment
296
‘Of course, I am an ass,’ he observed, sombre as a storm 
cloud, ‘but still … you are another.’
‘No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming 
of any folly.’
They walked along in silence and only when they were 
close to Raskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the si-
lence in considerable anxiety.
‘Listen,’ he said, ‘you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your 
other failings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty 
one, too. You are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of 
whims, you’re getting fat and lazy and can’t deny yourself 
anything—and I call that dirty because it leads one straight 
into the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack that I don’t 
know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor. 
You—a doctor—sleep on a feather bed and get up at night 
to your patients! In another three or four years you won’t 
get up for your patients … But hang it all, that’s not the 
point! … You are going to spend to-night in the landlady’s 
flat here. (Hard work I’ve had to persuade her!) And I’ll be 
in the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to get to know her 
better…. It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of any-
thing of the sort, brother …!’
‘But I don’t think!’
‘Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a 
savage virtue … and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, 
simply melting! Save me from her, by all that’s unholy! She’s 
most prepossessing … I’ll repay you, I’ll do anything….’
Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.
‘Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?’
 297‘It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you 
like to her, as long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, 
too; try curing her of something. I swear you won’t regret it. 
She has a piano, and you know, I strum a little. I have a song 
there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I shed hot tears.’ She likes the 
genuine article—and well, it all began with that song; Now 
you’re a regular performer, a maître a Rubinstein…. I assure 
you, you won’t regret it!’
‘But have you made her some promise? Something 
signed? A promise of marriage, perhaps?’
‘Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Be-
sides she is not that sort at all…. Tchebarov tried that….’
‘Well then, drop her!’
‘But I can’t drop her like that!’
‘Why can’t you?’
‘Well, I can’t, that’s all about it! There’s an element of at-
traction here, brother.’
‘Then why have you fascinated her?’
‘I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated my-
self in my folly. But she won’t care a straw whether it’s you 
or I, so long as somebody sits beside her, sighing…. I can’t 
explain the position, brother … look here, you are good at 
mathematics, and working at it now … begin teaching her 
the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m in 
earnest, it’ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and 
sigh for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two 
days at a time about the Prussian House of Lords (for one 
must talk of something)—she just sighed and perspired! 
And you mustn’t talk of love—she’s bashful to hysterics—
 Crime and Punishment

but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away—that’s 
enough. It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you 
can read, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a 
kiss, if you’re careful.’
‘But what do I want with her?’
‘Ach, I can’t make you understand! You see, you are made 
for each other! I have often been reminded of you! … You’ll 
come to it in the end! So does it matter whether it’s sooner 
or later? There’s the feather-bed element here, brother—ach! 
and not only that! There’s an attraction here—here you have 
the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven, the na-
vel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of 
the world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish- pies, of 
the evening samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and 
hot stoves to sleep on—as snug as though you were dead, 
and yet you’re alive—the advantages of both at once! Well, 
hang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s bedtime! Listen. 
I sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at him. 
But there’s no need, it’s all right. Don’t you worry yourself, 
yet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you 
notice anything—delirium or fever—wake me at once. But 
there can’t be….’

## Chapter 2

R
azumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, 
troubled and serious. He found himself confronted 
with many new and unlooked-for perplexities. He had nev-
er expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He 
remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew 
that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him, that he 
had received an impression unlike anything he had known 
before. At the same time he recognised clearly that the 
dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly un-
attainable—so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed 
of it, and he hastened to pass to the other more practical 
cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that ‘thrice ac-
cursed yesterday.’
The most awful recollection of the previous day was the 
way he had shown himself ‘base and mean,’ not only because 
he had been drunk, but because he had taken advantage of 
the young girl’s position to abuse her fiancé in his stupid 
jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual relations and ob-
ligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And what 
right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded 
manner? Who had asked for his opinion? Was it think-
able that such a creature as Avdotya Romanovna would be 
marrying an unworthy man for money? So there must be 
something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he 
 Crime and Punishment
300
know the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat 
… Foo! how despicable it all was! And what justification was 
it that he was drunk? Such a stupid excuse was even more 
degrading! In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, 
‘that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart’! 
And would such a dream ever be permissible to him, Razu-
mihin? What was he beside such a girl—he, the drunken 
noisy braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so 
absurd and cynical a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed 
desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection 
forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night 
on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya 
Romanovna … that was simply intolerable. He brought his 
fist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and 
sent one of the bricks flying.
‘Of course,’ he muttered to himself a minute later with a 
feeling of self-abasement, ‘of course, all these infamies can 
never be wiped out or smoothed over … and so it’s useless 
even to think of it, and I must go to them in silence and do 
my duty … in silence, too … and not ask forgiveness, and 
say nothing … for all is lost now!’
And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more care-
fully than usual. He hadn’t another suit—if he had had, 
perhaps he wouldn’t have put it on. ‘I would have made a 
point of not putting it on.’ But in any case he could not re-
main a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend 
the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of 
his assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his 
clothes carefully. His linen was always decent; in that re-
 301spect he was especially clean.
He washed that morning scrupulously—he got some 
soap from Nastasya— he washed his hair, his neck and es-
pecially his hands. When it came to the question whether 
to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna had 
capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the 
question was angrily answered in the negative. ‘Let it stay as 
it is! What if they think that I shaved on purpose to …? They 
certainly would think so! Not on any account!’
‘And … the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he 
had the manners of a pothouse; and … and even admitting 
that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman 
… what was there in that to be proud of? Everyone ought to 
be a gentleman and more than that … and all the same (he 
remembered) he, too, had done little things … not exact-
ly dishonest, and yet…. And what thoughts he sometimes 
had; hm … and to set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! 
Confound it! So be it! Well, he’d make a point then of be-
ing dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he wouldn’t 
care! He’d be worse!’
He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, 
who had spent the night in Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, 
came in.
He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the in-
valid first. Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was 
sleeping like a dormouse. Zossimov gave orders that they 
shouldn’t wake him and promised to see him again about 
eleven.
‘If he is still at home,’ he added. ‘Damn it all! If one can’t 
 Crime and Punishment
302
control one’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you 
know whether he will go to them, or whether they are com-
ing here?’
‘They are coming, I think,’ said Razumihin, understand-
ing the object of the question, ‘and they will discuss their 
family affairs, no doubt. I’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have 
more right to be here than I.’
‘But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; 
I’ve plenty to do besides looking after them.’
‘One thing worries me,’ interposed Razumihin, frown-
ing. ‘On the way home I talked a lot of drunken nonsense 
to him … all sorts of things … and amongst them that you 
were afraid that he … might become insane.’
‘You told the ladies so, too.’
‘I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did 
you think so seriously?’
‘That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it serious-
ly? You, yourself, described him as a monomaniac when 
you fetched me to him … and we added fuel to the fire yes-
terday, you did, that is, with your story about the painter; it 
was a nice conversation, when he was, perhaps, mad on that 
very point! If only I’d known what happened then at the 
police station and that some wretch … had insulted him 
with this suspicion! Hm … I would not have allowed that 
conversation yesterday. These monomaniacs will make a 
mountain out of a mole-hill … and see their fancies as sol-
id realities…. As far as I remember, it was Zametov’s story 
that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I know 
one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the 
 303throat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the 
jokes he made every day at table! And in this case his rags, 
the insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion! All 
that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria, 
and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That may well have 
been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it all! … And, 
by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but hm 
… he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful 
chatterbox!’
‘But whom did he tell it to? You and me?’
‘And Porfiry.’
‘What does that matter?’
‘And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his 
mother and sister? Tell them to be more careful with him 
to-day….’
‘They’ll get on all right!’ Razumihin answered reluctant-
ly.
‘Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money 
and she doesn’t seem to dislike him … and they haven’t a 
farthing, I suppose? eh?’
‘But what business is it of yours?’ Razumihin cried with 
annoyance. ‘How can I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask 
them yourself and perhaps you’ll find out….’
‘Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine 
has not gone off yet…. Good-bye; thank your Praskovya 
Pavlovna from me for my night’s lodging. She locked herself 
in, made no reply to my bonjour through the door; she was 
up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her from 
the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview….’
 Crime and Punishment
304
At nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodg-
ings at Bakaleyev’s house. Both ladies were waiting for him 
with nervous impatience. They had risen at seven o’clock or 
earlier. He entered looking as black as night, bowed awk-
wardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He had 
reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly 
rushed at him, seized him by both hands and was almost 
kissing them. He glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, 
but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expres-
sion of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and 
unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and ill-
disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into 
greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse. For-
tunately there was a subject for conversation, and he made 
haste to snatch at it.
Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya 
had not yet waked, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that 
she was glad to hear it, because ‘she had something which it 
was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.’ Then fol-
lowed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have 
it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya 
Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty 
waiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at 
last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies 
were ashamed. Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, 
but, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and 
was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s questions, 
which showered in a continual stream upon him.
He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly 
 305interrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describ-
ing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last 
year of Raskolnikov’s life, concluding with a circumstantial 
account of his illness. He omitted, however, many things, 
which were better omitted, including the scene at the po-
lice station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly 
to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and sat-
isfied his listeners, he found that they considered he had 
hardly begun.
‘Tell me, tell me! What do you think … ? Excuse me, I 
still don’t know your name!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna put 
in hastily.
‘Dmitri Prokofitch.’
‘I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch 
… how he looks … on things in general now, that is, how can 
I explain, what are his likes and dislikes? Is he always so ir-
ritable? Tell me, if you can, what are his hopes and, so to say, 
his dreams? Under what influences is he now? In a word, I 
should like …’
‘Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?’ ob-
served Dounia.
‘Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least 
like this, Dmitri Prokofitch!’
‘Naturally,’ answered Razumihin. ‘I have no mother, but 
my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can 
scarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he is a 
clever man; and your three years’ separation means a great 
deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for a year 
and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and 
 Crime and Punishment
306
of late—and perhaps for a long time before—he has been 
suspicious and fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind 
heart. He does not like showing his feelings and would rath-
er do a cruel thing than open his heart freely. Sometimes, 
though, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhu-
manly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between 
two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says 
he is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies 
in bed doing nothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because 
he hasn’t the wit, but as though he hadn’t time to waste on 
such trifles. He never listens to what is said to him. He is 
never interested in what interests other people at any given 
moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is 
right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most 
beneficial influence upon him.’
‘God grant it may,’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, dis-
tressed by Razumihin’s account of her Rodya.
And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Av-
dotya Romanovna at last. He glanced at her often while he 
was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again 
at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening at-
tentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro 
with her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasion-
ally putting in a question, without stopping her walk. She 
had the same habit of not listening to what was said. She 
was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white 
transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon de-
tected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings. Had 
Avdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that 
 307he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she 
was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her 
surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began 
to be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, 
which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident.
‘You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my 
brother’s character … and have told it impartially. I am glad. 
I thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him,’ ob-
served Avdotya Romanovna with a smile. ‘I think you are 
right that he needs a woman’s care,’ she added thoughtful-
ly.
‘I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only …’
‘What?’
‘He loves no one and perhaps he never will,’ Razumihin 
declared decisively.
‘You mean he is not capable of love?’
‘Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like 
your brother, in everything, indeed!’ he blurted out sud-
denly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what 
he had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a 
crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya Romanov-
na couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.
‘You may both be mistaken about Rodya,’ Pulcheria Al-
exandrovna remarked, slightly piqued. ‘I am not talking 
of our present difficulty, Dounia. What Pyotr Petrovitch 
writes in this letter and what you and I have supposed may 
be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how 
moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could de-
pend on what he would do when he was only fifteen. And I 
 Crime and Punishment
308
am sure that he might do something now that nobody else 
would think of doing … Well, for instance, do you know how 
a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock 
that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that 
girl—what was her name—his landlady’s daughter?’
‘Did you hear about that affair?’ asked Avdotya Ro-
manovna.
‘Do you suppose——‘ Pulcheria Alexandrovna contin-
ued warmly. ‘Do you suppose that my tears, my entreaties, 
my illness, my possible death from grief, our poverty would 
have made him pause? No, he would calmly have disregard-
ed all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!’
‘He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,’ Razu-
mihin answered cautiously. ‘But I did hear something from 
Praskovya Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a 
gossip. And what I heard certainly was rather strange.’
‘And what did you hear?’ both the ladies asked at once.
‘Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the mar-
riage, which only failed to take place through the girl’s 
death, was not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They 
say, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact I am told posi-
tively ugly … and such an invalid … and queer. But she 
seems to have had some good qualities. She must have had 
some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable…. She had no 
money either and he wouldn’t have considered her money…. 
But it’s always difficult to judge in such matters.’
‘I am sure she was a good girl,’ Avdotya Romanovna ob-
served briefly.
‘God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I 
 309don’t know which of them would have caused most misery 
to the other—he to her or she to him,’ Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna concluded. Then she began tentatively questioning 
him about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hes-
itating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to 
the latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest 
evidently caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razu-
mihin described it in detail again, but this time he added 
his own conclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for 
intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not seeking to ex-
cuse him on the score of his illness.
‘He had planned it before his illness,’ he added.
‘I think so, too,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a 
dejected air. But she was very much surprised at hearing 
Razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a 
certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch. Avdotya Romanov-
na, too, was struck by it.
‘So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?’ Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna could not resist asking.
‘I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future 
husband,’ Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, 
‘and I don’t say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because 
… simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free 
will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so rudely of him 
last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and … 
mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely … 
and this morning I am ashamed of it.’
He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanov-
na flushed, but did not break the silence. She had not uttered 
 Crime and Punishment
310
a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin.
Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously 
did not know what to do. At last, faltering and continually 
glancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceed-
ingly worried by one circumstance.
‘You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she began. ‘I’ll be perfectly 
open with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?’
‘Of course, mother,’ said Avdotya Romanovna emphati-
cally.
‘This is what it is,’ she began in haste, as though the 
permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her 
mind. ‘Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr 
Petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival. He 
promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of 
that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodg-
ings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he 
would be here himself this morning. But this morning this 
note came from him. You’d better read it yourself; there 
is one point in it which worries me very much … you will 
soon see what that is, and … tell me your candid opinion, 
Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than 
anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dou-
nia, I must tell you, made her decision at once, but I still 
don’t feel sure how to act and I … I’ve been waiting for your 
opinion.’
Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previ-
ous evening and read as follows:
‘Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the hon-
our to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was 
 311rendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a 
very competent person with the same object in view. I like-
wise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with 
you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does 
not admit of delay, and also that I may not intrude on your 
family circle while you are meeting your son, and Avdotya 
Romanovna her brother. I shall have the honour of visit-
ing you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not 
later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and 
herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, 
imperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be 
present at our interview—as he offered me a gross and un-
precedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in 
his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire from you 
personally an indispensable and circumstantial explana-
tion upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn 
your own interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, 
in anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion 
Romanovitch, I shall be compelled to withdraw immedi-
ately and then you have only yourself to blame. I write on 
the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so 
ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, 
being able to leave the house, may visit you also. I was con-
firmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in 
the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has 
since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notori-
ous behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext 
of the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what 
pains you were at to raise that sum. Herewith expressing 
 Crime and Punishment
312
my special respect to your estimable daughter, Avdotya Ro-
manovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage of
‘Your humble servant,
‘P. LUZHIN.’
‘What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?’ began Pulche-
ria Alexandrovna, almost weeping. ‘How can I ask Rodya 
not to come? Yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our re-
fusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to 
receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and … 
what will happen then?’
‘Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,’ Razumihin an-
swered calmly at once.
‘Oh, dear me! She says … goodness knows what she says, 
she doesn’t explain her object! She says that it would be best, 
at least, not that it would be best, but that it’s absolutely 
necessary that Rodya should make a point of being here at 
eight o’clock and that they must meet…. I didn’t want even 
to show him the letter, but to prevent him from coming by 
some stratagem with your help … because he is so irrita-
ble…. Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who 
died and that daughter, and how he could have given the 
daughter all the money … which …’
‘Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,’ put in Avdotya 
Romanovna.
‘He was not himself yesterday,’ Razumihin said thought-
fully, ‘if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant 
yesterday, though there was sense in it too…. Hm! He did 
say something, as we were going home yesterday evening, 
about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand a 
 313word…. But last night, I myself …’
‘The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him our-
selves and there I assure you we shall see at once what’s to 
be done. Besides, it’s getting late—good heavens, it’s past 
ten,’ she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch 
which hung round her neck on a thin Venetian chain, and 
looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress. ‘A 
present from her fiancé ’ thought Razumihin.
‘We must start, Dounia, we must start,’ her mother cried 
in a flutter. ‘He will be thinking we are still angry after yes-
terday, from our coming so late. Merciful heavens!’
While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat 
and mantle; Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as 
Razumihin noticed, were not merely shabby but had holes 
in them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an 
air of special dignity, which is always found in people who 
know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked rever-
ently at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. ‘The queen 
who mended her stockings in prison,’ he thought, ‘must 
have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen 
than at sumptuous banquets and levées.’
‘My God!’ exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, ‘little did 
I think that I should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, 
darling Rodya! I am afraid, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she added, 
glancing at him timidly.
‘Don’t be afraid, mother,’ said Dounia, kissing her, ‘better 
have faith in him.’
‘Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,’ 
exclaimed the poor woman.
 Crime and Punishment
314
They came out into the street.
‘Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morn-
ing I dreamed of Marfa Petrovna … she was all in white … 
she came up to me, took my hand, and shook her head at 
me, but so sternly as though she were blaming me…. Is that 
a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri Pro-
kofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!’
‘No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?’
‘She died suddenly; and only fancy …’
‘Afterwards, mamma,’ put in Dounia. ‘He doesn’t know 
who Marfa Petrovna is.’
‘Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew 
all about us. Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know 
what I am thinking about these last few days. I look upon 
you really as a providence for us, and so I took it for granted 
that you knew all about us. I look on you as a relation…. 
Don’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the 
matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?’
‘Yes, I bruised it,’ muttered Razumihin overjoyed.
‘I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dou-
nia finds fault with me…. But, dear me, what a cupboard he 
lives in! I wonder whether he is awake? Does this woman, 
his landlady, consider it a room? Listen, you say he does not 
like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy him with 
my … weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how 
am I to treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.’
‘Don’t question him too much about anything if you see 
him frown; don’t ask him too much about his health; he 
doesn’t like that.’
 315‘Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But 
here are the stairs…. What an awful staircase!’
‘Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, dar-
ling,’ said Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she 
added: ‘He ought to be happy at seeing you, and you are tor-
menting yourself so.’
‘Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.’
The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on 
before, and when they reached the landlady’s door on the 
fourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack 
open and that two keen black eyes were watching them 
from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door 
was suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna almost cried out.

## Chapter 3

‘H
e is well, quite well!’ Zossimov cried cheerfully as 
they entered.
He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the 
same place as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in 
the opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully washed and 
combed, as he had not been for some time past. The room 
was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed to follow 
the visitors in and stayed to listen.
Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with 
his condition the day before, but he was still pale, listless, 
and sombre. He looked like a wounded man or one who has 
undergone some terrible physical suffering. His brows were 
knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke lit-
tle and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there 
was a restlessness in his movements.
He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his 
finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful 
abscess or a broken arm. The pale, sombre face lighted up 
for a moment when his mother and sister entered, but this 
only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in place of its 
listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look of 
suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying 
his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to 
practise, noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother 
 317and sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to bear 
another hour or two of inevitable torture. He saw later that 
almost every word of the following conversation seemed to 
touch on some sore place and irritate it. But at the same time 
he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hid-
ing his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a 
monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.
‘Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,’ said Raskol-
nikov, giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which 
made Pulcheria Alexandrovna radiant at once. ‘And I don’t 
say this as I did yesterday ’ he said, addressing Razumihin, 
with a friendly pressure of his hand.
‘Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,’ began 
Zossimov, much delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had 
not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient 
for ten minutes. ‘In another three or four days, if he goes on 
like this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month 
ago, or two … or perhaps even three. This has been com-
ing on for a long while…. eh? Confess, now, that it has been 
perhaps your own fault?’ he added, with a tentative smile, as 
though still afraid of irritating him.
‘It is very possible,’ answered Raskolnikov coldly.
‘I should say, too,’ continued Zossimov with zest, ‘that 
your complete recovery depends solely on yourself. Now 
that one can talk to you, I should like to impress upon 
you that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, 
fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid con-
dition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from 
bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but 
 Crime and Punishment
318
they must be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and 
must have observed yourself, of course. I fancy the first 
stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the 
university. You must not be left without occupation, and so, 
work and a definite aim set before you might, I fancy, be 
very beneficial.’
‘Yes, yes; you are perfectly right…. I will make haste 
and return to the university: and then everything will go 
smoothly….’
Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to 
make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat 
mystified, when, glancing at his patient, he observed unmis-
takable mockery on his face. This lasted an instant, however. 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking Zossimov, 
especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
‘What! he saw you last night?’ Raskolnikov asked, as 
though startled. ‘Then you have not slept either after your 
journey.’
‘Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I 
never go to bed before two at home.’
‘I don’t know how to thank him either,’ Raskolnikov went 
on, suddenly frowning and looking down. ‘Setting aside 
the question of payment— forgive me for referring to it (he 
turned to Zossimov)—I really don’t know what I have done 
to deserve such special attention from you! I simply don’t 
understand it … and … and … it weighs upon me, indeed, 
because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.’
‘Don’t be irritated.’ Zossimov forced himself to laugh. 
‘Assume that you are my first patient—well—we fellows just 
 319beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were 
our children, and some almost fall in love with them. And, 
of course, I am not rich in patients.’
‘I say nothing about him,’ added Raskolnikov, pointing 
to Razumihin, ‘though he has had nothing from me either 
but insult and trouble.’
‘What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a senti-
mental mood to-day, are you?’ shouted Razumihin.
If he had had more penetration he would have seen that 
there was no trace of sentimentality in him, but something 
indeed quite the opposite. But Avdotya Romanovna noticed 
it. She was intently and uneasily watching her brother.
‘As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,’ he went on, as 
though repeating a lesson learned by heart. ‘It is only to-
day that I have been able to realise a little how distressed 
you must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come 
back.’
When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to 
his sister, smiling without a word. But in this smile there 
was a flash of real unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at 
once, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thank-
ful. It was the first time he had addressed her since their 
dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up with 
ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken 
reconciliation. ‘Yes, that is what I love him for,’ Razumihin, 
exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous 
turn in his chair. ‘He has these movements.’
‘And how well he does it all,’ the mother was thinking to 
herself. ‘What generous impulses he has, and how simply, 
 Crime and Punishment
320
how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding 
with his sister—simply by holding out his hand at the right 
minute and looking at her like that…. And what fine eyes 
he has, and how fine his whole face is! … He is even bet-
ter looking than Dounia…. But, good heavens, what a suit 
—how terribly he’s dressed! … Vasya, the messenger boy 
in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is better dressed! I could rush 
at him and hug him … weep over him—but I am afraid…. 
Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m afraid! 
Why, what am I afraid of? …’
‘Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,’ she began suddenly, 
in haste to answer his words to her, ‘how unhappy Dounia 
and I were yesterday! Now that it’s all over and done with 
and we are quite happy again—I can tell you. Fancy, we ran 
here almost straight from the train to embrace you and that 
woman—ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya! … She 
told us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had 
just run away from the doctor in delirium, and they were 
looking for you in the streets. You can’t imagine how we 
felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the tragic end of Lieutenant 
Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s— you can’t remember 
him, Rodya—who ran out in the same way in a high fever 
and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t 
pull him out till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. 
We were on the point of rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to 
ask him to help…. Because we were alone, utterly alone,’ she 
said plaintively and stopped short, suddenly, recollecting it 
was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr Petrovitch, 
although ‘we are quite happy again.’
 321‘Yes, yes…. Of course it’s very annoying….’ Raskolnikov 
muttered in reply, but with such a preoccupied and inatten-
tive air that Dounia gazed at him in perplexity.
‘What else was it I wanted to say?’ He went on trying 
to recollect. ‘Oh, yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please 
don’t think that I didn’t mean to come and see you to-day 
and was waiting for you to come first.’
‘What are you saying, Rodya?’ cried Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna. She, too, was surprised.
‘Is he answering us as a duty?’ Dounia wondered. ‘Is he 
being reconciled and asking forgiveness as though he were 
performing a rite or repeating a lesson?’
‘I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was 
delayed owing to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her … 
Nastasya … to wash out the blood … I’ve only just dressed.’
‘Blood! What blood?’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in 
alarm.
‘Oh, nothing—don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wan-
dering about yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a 
man who had been run over … a clerk …’
‘Delirious? But you remember everything!’ Razumihin 
interrupted.
‘That’s true,’ Raskolnikov answered with special careful-
ness. ‘I remember everything even to the slightest detail, 
and yet—why I did that and went there and said that, I can’t 
clearly explain now.’
‘A familiar phenomenon,’ interposed Zossimov, ‘actions 
are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning 
way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and de-
 Crime and Punishment
322
pendent on various morbid impressions— it’s like a dream.’
‘Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me 
almost a madman,’ thought Raskolnikov.
‘Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,’ 
observed Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.
‘There is some truth in your observation,’ the latter re-
plied. ‘In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like 
madmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged 
are somewhat madder, for we must draw a line. A normal 
man, it is true, hardly exists. Among dozens—perhaps hun-
dreds of thousands—hardly one is to be met with.’
At the word ‘madman,’ carelessly dropped by Zossimov 
in his chatter on his favourite subject, everyone frowned.
Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged 
in thought with a strange smile on his pale lips. He was still 
meditating on something.
‘Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupt-
ed you!’ Razumihin cried hastily.
‘What?’ Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. ‘Oh … I got 
spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging. 
By the way, mamma, I did an unpardonable thing yesterday. 
I was literally out of my mind. I gave away all the money you 
sent me … to his wife for the funeral. She’s a widow now, 
in consumption, a poor creature … three little children, 
starving … nothing in the house … there’s a daughter, too 
… perhaps you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. 
But I had no right to do it I admit, especially as I knew how 
you needed the money yourself. To help others one must 
have the right to do it, or else Crevez, chiens, si vous n’êtes 
 323pas contents. ’ He laughed, ‘That’s right, isn’t it, Dounia?’
‘No, it’s not,’ answered Dounia firmly.
‘Bah! you, too, have ideals,’ he muttered, looking at her 
almost with hatred, and smiling sarcastically. ‘I ought to 
have considered that…. Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s 
better for you … and if you reach a line you won’t overstep, 
you will be unhappy … and if you overstep it, maybe you 
will be still unhappier…. But all that’s nonsense,’ he added 
irritably, vexed at being carried away. ‘I only meant to say 
that I beg your forgiveness, mother,’ he concluded, shortly 
and abruptly.
‘That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do 
is very good,’ said his mother, delighted.
‘Don’t be too sure,’ he answered, twisting his mouth into 
a smile.
A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all 
this conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconcilia-
tion, and in the forgiveness, and all were feeling it.
‘It is as though they were afraid of me,’ Raskolnikov was 
thinking to himself, looking askance at his mother and 
sister. Pulcheria Alexandrovna was indeed growing more 
timid the longer she kept silent.
‘Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,’ 
flashed through his mind.
‘Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,’ Pulcheria 
Alexandrovna suddenly blurted out.
‘What Marfa Petrovna?’
‘Oh, mercy on us—Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote 
you so much about her.’
 Crime and Punishment
324
‘A-a-h! Yes, I remember…. So she’s dead! Oh, really?’ he 
roused himself suddenly, as if waking up. ‘What did she die 
of?’
‘Only imagine, quite suddenly,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
answered hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. ‘On the 
very day I was sending you that letter! Would you believe it, 
that awful man seems to have been the cause of her death. 
They say he beat her dreadfully.’
‘Why, were they on such bad terms?’ he asked, address-
ing his sister.
‘Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was 
always very patient, considerate even. In fact, all those sev-
en years of their married life he gave way to her, too much 
so indeed, in many cases. All of a sudden he seems to have 
lost patience.’
‘Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled 
himself for seven years? You seem to be defending him, 
Dounia?’
‘No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more 
awful!’ Dounia answered, almost with a shudder, knitting 
her brows, and sinking into thought.
‘That had happened in the morning,’ Pulcheria Alex-
androvna went on hurriedly. ‘And directly afterwards she 
ordered the horses to be harnessed to drive to the town im-
mediately after dinner. She always used to drive to the town 
in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am told….’
‘After the beating?’
‘That was always her … habit; and immediately after 
dinner, so as not to be late in starting, she went to the bath-
 325house…. You see, she was undergoing some treatment with 
baths. They have a cold spring there, and she used to bathe 
in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got into the 
water when she suddenly had a stroke!’
‘I should think so,’ said Zossimov.
‘And did he beat her badly?’
‘What does that matter!’ put in Dounia.
‘H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gos-
sip, mother,’ said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite 
of himself.
‘Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,’ broke 
from Pulcheria Alexandrovna.
‘Why, are you all afraid of me?’ he asked, with a con-
strained smile.
‘That’s certainly true,’ said Dounia, looking directly and 
sternly at her brother. ‘Mother was crossing herself with 
terror as she came up the stairs.’
His face worked, as though in convulsion.
‘Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, 
Rodya…. Why did you say that, Dounia?’ Pulcheria Alex-
androvna began, overwhelmed—‘You see, coming here, I 
was dreaming all the way, in the train, how we should meet, 
how we should talk over everything together…. And I was 
so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what am I say-
ing? I am happy now…. You should not, Dounia…. I am 
happy now—simply in seeing you, Rodya….’
‘Hush, mother,’ he muttered in confusion, not looking 
at her, but pressing her hand. ‘We shall have time to speak 
freely of everything!’
 Crime and Punishment
326
As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with con-
fusion and turned pale. Again that awful sensation he had 
known of late passed with deadly chill over his soul. Again 
it became suddenly plain and perceptible to him that he had 
just told a fearful lie—that he would never now be able to 
speak freely of everything—that he would never again be 
able to speak of anything to anyone. The anguish of this 
thought was such that for a moment he almost forgot him-
self. He got up from his seat, and not looking at anyone 
walked towards the door.
‘What are you about?’ cried Razumihin, clutching him 
by the arm.
He sat down again, and began looking about him, in si-
lence. They were all looking at him in perplexity.
‘But what are you all so dull for?’ he shouted, suddenly 
and quite unexpectedly. ‘Do say something! What’s the use 
of sitting like this? Come, do speak. Let us talk…. We meet 
together and sit in silence…. Come, anything!’
‘Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday 
was beginning again,’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, cross-
ing herself.
‘What is the matter, Rodya?’ asked Avdotya Romanovna, 
distrustfully.
‘Oh, nothing! I remembered something,’ he answered, 
and suddenly laughed.
‘Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right! … I 
was beginning to think …’ muttered Zossimov, getting up 
from the sofa. ‘It is time for me to be off. I will look in again 
perhaps … if I can …’ He made his bows, and went out.
 327‘What an excellent man!’ observed Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna.
‘Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,’ Ras-
kolnikov began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, 
and a liveliness he had not shown till then. ‘I can’t remem-
ber where I met him before my illness…. I believe I have 
met him somewhere—— … And this is a good man, too,’ he 
nodded at Razumihin. ‘Do you like him, Dounia?’ he asked 
her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.
‘Very much,’ answered Dounia.
‘Foo!—what a pig you are!’ Razumihin protested, blush-
ing in terrible confusion, and he got up from his chair. 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled faintly, but Raskolnikov 
laughed aloud.
‘Where are you off to?’
‘I must go.’
‘You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you 
must. Don’t go. What’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What 
a pretty watch you have got, Dounia. But why are you all si-
lent again? I do all the talking.’
‘It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,’ answered Dou-
nia.
‘And a very expensive one!’ added Pulcheria Alexandrov-
na.
‘A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.’
‘I like that sort,’ said Dounia.
‘So it is not a present from her fiancé ’ thought Razumi-
hin, and was unreasonably delighted.
‘I thought it was Luzhin’s present,’ observed Raskol-
 Crime and Punishment
328
nikov.
‘No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.’
‘A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and 
wanted to get married?’ he said suddenly, looking at his 
mother, who was disconcerted by the sudden change of sub-
ject and the way he spoke of it.
‘Oh, yes, my dear.’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dou-
nia and Razumihin.
‘H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much 
indeed. She was such a sickly girl,’ he went on, growing 
dreamy and looking down again. ‘Quite an invalid. She was 
fond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming 
of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began 
talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember 
very well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know 
what drew me to her then—I think it was because she was 
always ill. If she had been lame or hunchback, I believe I 
should have liked her better still,’ he smiled dreamily. ‘Yes, 
it was a sort of spring delirium.’
‘No, it was not only spring delirium,’ said Dounia, with 
warm feeling.
He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not 
hear or did not understand her words. Then, completely 
lost in thought, he got up, went up to his mother, kissed her, 
went back to his place and sat down.
‘You love her even now?’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, 
touched.
‘Her? Now? Oh, yes…. You ask about her? No … that’s 
 329all now, as it were, in another world … and so long ago. 
And indeed everything happening here seems somehow far 
away.’ He looked attentively at them. ‘You, now … I seem to 
be looking at you from a thousand miles away … but, good-
ness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use 
of asking about it?’ he added with annoyance, and biting his 
nails, fell into dreamy silence again.
‘What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a 
tomb,’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the 
oppressive silence. ‘I am sure it’s quite half through your 
lodging you have become so melancholy.’
‘My lodging,’ he answered, listlessly. ‘Yes, the lodging 
had a great deal to do with it…. I thought that, too…. If 
only you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just 
now, mother,’ he said, laughing strangely.
A little more, and their companionship, this mother and 
this sister, with him after three years’ absence, this intimate 
tone of conversation, in face of the utter impossibility of re-
ally speaking about anything, would have been beyond his 
power of endurance. But there was one urgent matter which 
must be settled one way or the other that day—so he had 
decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as 
a means of escape.
‘Listen, Dounia,’ he began, gravely and drily, ‘of course I 
beg your pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to 
tell you again that I do not withdraw from my chief point. It 
is me or Luzhin. If I am a scoundrel, you must not be. One 
is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease at once to look on 
you as a sister.’
 Crime and Punishment
330
‘Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,’ Pulche-
ria Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. ‘And why do you call 
yourself a scoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yes-
terday.’
‘Brother,’ Dounia answered firmly and with the same 
dryness. ‘In all this there is a mistake on your part. I 
thought it over at night, and found out the mistake. It is all 
because you seem to fancy I am sacrificing myself to some-
one and for someone. That is not the case at all. I am simply 
marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for me. 
Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful 
to my family. But that is not the chief motive for my deci-
sion….’
‘She is lying,’ he thought to himself, biting his nails vin-
dictively. ‘Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do 
it out of charity! Too haughty! Oh, base characters! They 
even love as though they hate…. Oh, how I … hate them 
all!’
‘In fact,’ continued Dounia, ‘I am marrying Pyotr Petro-
vitch because of two evils I choose the less. I intend to do 
honestly all he expects of me, so I am not deceiving him…. 
Why did you smile just now?’ She, too, flushed, and there 
was a gleam of anger in her eyes.
‘All?’ he asked, with a malignant grin.
‘Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of 
Pyotr Petrovitch’s courtship showed me at once what he 
wanted. He may, of course, think too well of himself, but I 
hope he esteems me, too…. Why are you laughing again?’
‘And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. 
 331You are intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, 
simply to hold your own against me…. You cannot respect 
Luzhin. I have seen him and talked with him. So you are 
selling yourself for money, and so in any case you are acting 
basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.’
‘It is not true. I am not lying,’ cried Dounia, losing her 
composure. ‘I would not marry him if I were not convinced 
that he esteems me and thinks highly of me. I would not 
marry him if I were not firmly convinced that I can respect 
him. Fortunately, I can have convincing proof of it this very 
day … and such a marriage is not a vileness, as you say! And 
even if you were right, if I really had determined on a vile 
action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like 
that? Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps 
you have not either? It is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin 
anyone, it is only myself…. I am not committing a murder. 
Why do you look at me like that? Why are you so pale? Ro-
dya, darling, what’s the matter?’
‘Good heavens! You have made him faint,’ cried Pulche-
ria Alexandrovna.
‘No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness—not 
fainting. You have fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was 
I saying? Oh, yes. In what way will you get convincing proof 
to-day that you can respect him, and that he … esteems you, 
as you said. I think you said to-day?’
‘Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,’ said Dou-
nia.
With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave 
him the letter. He took it with great interest, but, before 
 Crime and Punishment
332
opening it, he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at 
Dounia.
‘It is strange,’ he said, slowly, as though struck by a new 
idea. ‘What am I making such a fuss for? What is it all 
about? Marry whom you like!’
He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and 
looked for some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He 
opened the letter at last, still with the same look of strange 
wonder on his face. Then, slowly and attentively, he began 
reading, and read it through twice. Pulcheria Alexandrovna 
showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something 
particular.
‘What surprises me,’ he began, after a short pause, hand-
ing the letter to his mother, but not addressing anyone in 
particular, ‘is that he is a business man, a lawyer, and his 
conversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such 
an uneducated letter.’
They all started. They had expected something quite dif-
ferent.
‘But they all write like that, you know,’ Razumihin ob-
served, abruptly.
‘Have you read it?’
‘Yes.’
‘We showed him, Rodya. We … consulted him just now,’ 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.
‘That’s just the jargon of the courts,’ Razumihin put in. 
‘Legal documents are written like that to this day.’
‘Legal? Yes, it’s just legal—business language—not so very 
uneducated, and not quite educated—business language!’
 333‘Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had 
a cheap education, he is proud indeed of having made his 
own way,’ Avdotya Romanovna observed, somewhat of-
fended by her brother’s tone.
‘Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You 
seem to be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivo-
lous criticism on the letter, and to think that I speak of such 
trifling matters on purpose to annoy you. It is quite the con-
trary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me 
that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There is one 
expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and 
plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at 
once if I am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to 
a threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to 
abandon you now after summoning you to Petersburg. Well, 
what do you think? Can one resent such an expression from 
Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had 
written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?’
‘N-no,’ answered Dounia, with more animation. ‘I saw 
clearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps 
he simply has no skill in writing … that is a true criticism, 
brother. I did not expect, indeed …’
‘It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than per-
haps he intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There 
is one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and 
rather a contemptible one. I gave the money last night to 
the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, 
and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay for 
the funeral, and not to the daughter—a young woman, as 
 Crime and Punishment
334
he writes, of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for 
the first time in my life)—but to the widow. In all this I see 
a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension be-
tween us. It is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, 
with a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve 
eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, in-
telligence is not enough. It all shows the man and … I don’t 
think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to 
warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good …’
Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She 
was only awaiting the evening.
‘Then what is your decision, Rodya?’ asked Pulcheria Al-
exandrovna, who was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, 
new businesslike tone of his talk.
‘What decision?’
‘You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be 
with us this evening, and that he will go away if you come. 
So will you … come?’
‘That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, 
if you are not offended by such a request; and secondly, by 
Dounia, if she, too, is not offended. I will do what you think 
best,’ he added, drily.
‘Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,’ 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare.
‘I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be 
with us at this interview,’ said Dounia. ‘Will you come?’
‘Yes.’
‘I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,’ she said, 
addressing Razumihin. ‘Mother, I am inviting him, too.’
 335‘Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,’ 
added Pulcheria Alexandrovna, ‘so be it. I shall feel easier 
myself. I do not like concealment and deception. Better let 
us have the whole truth…. Pyotr Petrovitch may be angry 
or not, now!’

## Chapter 4

A
t that moment the door was softly opened, and a young 
girl walked into the room, looking timidly about her. 
Everyone turned towards her with surprise and curiosity. 
At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise her. It was So-
fya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday 
for the first time, but at such a moment, in such surround-
ings and in such a dress, that his memory retained a very 
different image of her. Now she was a modestly and poorly-
dressed young girl, very young, indeed, almost like a child, 
with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but some-
what frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain 
indoor dress, and had on a shabby old- fashioned hat, but 
she still carried a parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room 
full of people, she was not so much embarrassed as com-
pletely overwhelmed with shyness, like a little child. She 
was even about to retreat. ‘Oh … it’s you!’ said Raskolnikov, 
extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once 
recollected that his mother and sister knew through Lu-
zhin’s letter of ‘some young woman of notorious behaviour.’ 
He had only just been protesting against Luzhin’s calumny 
and declaring that he had seen the girl last night for the 
first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He remembered, 
too, that he had not protested against the expression ‘of no-
torious behaviour.’ All this passed vaguely and fleetingly 
 337through his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw 
that the humiliated creature was so humiliated that he felt 
suddenly sorry for her. When she made a movement to re-
treat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.
‘I did not expect you,’ he said, hurriedly, with a look that 
made her stop. ‘Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from 
Katerina Ivanovna. Allow me—not there. Sit here….’
At Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on 
one of Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up 
to allow her to enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the 
place on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting, but feel-
ing that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too familiar 
a place, he hurriedly motioned her to Razumihin’s chair.
‘You sit here,’ he said to Razumihin, putting him on the 
sofa.
Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked 
timidly at the two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceiv-
able to herself that she could sit down beside them. At the 
thought of it, she was so frightened that she hurriedly got 
up again, and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov.
‘I … I … have come for one minute. Forgive me for dis-
turbing you,’ she began falteringly. ‘I come from Katerina 
Ivanovna, and she had no one to send. Katerina Ivanovna 
told me to beg you … to be at the service … in the morning 
… at Mitrofanievsky … and then … to us … to her … to do 
her the honour … she told me to beg you …’ Sonia stam-
mered and ceased speaking.
‘I will try, certainly, most certainly,’ answered Raskol-
nikov. He, too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not 
 Crime and Punishment
338
finish his sentence. ‘Please sit down,’ he said, suddenly. ‘I 
want to talk to you. You are perhaps in a hurry, but please, 
be so kind, spare me two minutes,’ and he drew up a chair 
for her.
Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hur-
ried, frightened look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. 
Raskolnikov’s pale face flushed, a shudder passed over him, 
his eyes glowed.
‘Mother,’ he said, firmly and insistently, ‘this is Sofya 
Semyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortu-
nate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run over yesterday before 
my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly 
screwed up her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before 
Rodya’s urgent and challenging look, she could not deny 
herself that satisfaction. Dounia gazed gravely and intently 
into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised her with perplex-
ity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise her eyes 
again, but was more embarrassed than ever.
‘I wanted to ask you,’ said Raskolnikov, hastily, ‘how 
things were arranged yesterday. You were not worried by 
the police, for instance?’
‘No, that was all right … it was too evident, the cause of 
death … they did not worry us … only the lodgers are an-
gry.’
‘Why?’
‘At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. 
So that, to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the 
chapel, until to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was un-
 339willing, but now she sees herself that it’s necessary …’
‘To-day, then?’
‘She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church 
to-morrow for the service, and then to be present at the fu-
neral lunch.’
‘She is giving a funeral lunch?’
‘Yes … just a little…. She told me to thank you very much 
for helping us yesterday. But for you, we should have had 
nothing for the funeral.’
All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with 
an effort, she controlled herself, looking down again.
During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her 
carefully. She had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather 
irregular and angular, with a sharp little nose and chin. She 
could not have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were 
so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such a kind-
liness and simplicity in her expression that one could not 
help being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, 
had another peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen 
years, she looked almost a little girl—almost a child. And in 
some of her gestures, this childishness seemed almost ab-
surd.
‘But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with 
such small means? Does she even mean to have a funeral 
lunch?’ Raskolnikov asked, persistently keeping up the con-
versation.
‘The coffin will be plain, of course … and everything will 
be plain, so it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I 
have reckoned it all out, so that there will be enough left
 
 Crime and Punishment
340
… and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious it should be so. 
You know one can’t … it’s a comfort to her … she is like that, 
you know….’
‘I understand, I understand … of course … why do you 
look at my room like that? My mother has just said it is like 
a tomb.’
‘You gave us everything yesterday,’ Sonia said suddenly, 
in reply, in a loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down 
in confusion. Her lips and chin were trembling once more. 
She had been struck at once by Raskolnikov’s poor sur-
roundings, and now these words broke out spontaneously. 
A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes, and 
even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.
‘Rodya,’ she said, getting up, ‘we shall have dinner togeth-
er, of course. Come, Dounia…. And you, Rodya, had better 
go for a little walk, and then rest and lie down before you 
come to see us…. I am afraid we have exhausted you….’
‘Yes, yes, I’ll come,’ he answered, getting up fussily. ‘But I 
have something to see to.’
‘But surely you will have dinner together?’ cried Razu-
mihin, looking in surprise at Raskolnikov. ‘What do you 
mean?’
‘Yes, yes, I am coming … of course, of course! And you 
stay a minute. You do not want him just now, do you, moth-
er? Or perhaps I am taking him from you?’
‘Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the 
favour of dining with us?’
‘Please do,’ added Dounia.
Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, 
 341they were all strangely embarrassed.
‘Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like say-
ing good-bye. Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye 
again.’
Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but 
it somehow failed to come off, and she went in a flutter out 
of the room.
But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and 
following her mother out, gave Sonia an attentive, courte-
ous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave a hurried, frightened 
curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort in her face, 
as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention 
were oppressive and painful to her.
‘Dounia, good-bye,’ called Raskolnikov, in the passage. 
‘Give me your hand.’
‘Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?’ said Dou-
nia, turning warmly and awkwardly to him.
‘Never mind, give it to me again.’ And he squeezed her 
fingers warmly.
Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went 
off quite happy.
‘Come, that’s capital,’ he said to Sonia, going back and 
looking brightly at her. ‘God give peace to the dead, the liv-
ing have still to live. That is right, isn’t it?’
Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his 
face. He looked at her for some moments in silence. The 
whole history of the dead father floated before his memory 
in those moments….

‘Heavens, Dounia,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as 
soon as they were in the street, ‘I really feel relieved myself 
at coming away—more at ease. How little did I think yester-
day in the train that I could ever be glad of that.’
‘I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see 
it? Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be pa-
tient, and much, much can be forgiven.’
‘Well, you were not very patient!’ Pulcheria Alexan-
drovna caught her up, hotly and jealously. ‘Do you know, 
Dounia, I was looking at you two. You are the very portrait 
of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You are both 
melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty 
and both generous…. Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. 
Eh? When I think of what is in store for us this evening, my 
heart sinks!’
‘Don’t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.’
‘Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if 
Pyotr Petrovitch breaks it off?’ poor Pulcheria Alexandrov-
na blurted out, incautiously.
‘He won’t be worth much if he does,’ answered Dounia, 
sharply and contemptuously.
‘We did well to come away,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hur-
riedly broke in. ‘He was in a hurry about some business or 
other. If he gets out and has a breath of air … it is fearfully 
close in his room…. But where is one to get a breath of air 
here? The very streets here feel like shut-up rooms. Good 
heavens! what a town! … stay … this side … they will crush 
you—carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I 
declare … how they push! … I am very much afraid of that 
 343young woman, too.’
‘What young woman, mother?
‘Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.’
‘Why?’
‘I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it 
or not, but as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt 
that she was the chief cause of the trouble….’
‘Nothing of the sort!’ cried Dounia, in vexation. ‘What 
nonsense, with your presentiments, mother! He only made 
her acquaintance the evening before, and he did not know 
her when she came in.’
‘Well, you will see…. She worries me; but you will see, 
you will see! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with 
those eyes. I could scarcely sit still in my chair when he be-
gan introducing her, do you remember? It seems so strange, 
but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that about her, and he in-
troduces her to us—to you! So he must think a great deal 
of her.’
‘People will write anything. We were talked about and 
written about, too. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is 
a good girl, and that it is all nonsense.’
‘God grant it may be!’
‘And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,’ Dou-
nia snapped out, suddenly.
Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation 
was not resumed.
*****
‘I will tell you what I want with you,’ said Raskolnikov, 
drawing Razumihin to the window.
 Crime and Punishment
344
‘Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,’ 
Sonia said hurriedly, preparing to depart.
‘One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. 
You are not in our way. I want to have another word or two 
with you. Listen!’ he turned suddenly to Razumihin again. 
‘You know that … what’s his name … Porfiry Petrovitch?’
‘I should think so! He is a relation. Why?’ added the lat-
ter, with interest.
‘Is not he managing that case … you know, about that 
murder? … You were speaking about it yesterday.’
‘Yes … well?’ Razumihin’s eyes opened wide.
‘He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, 
and I have some pledges there, too—trifles—a ring my sis-
ter gave me as a keepsake when I left home, and my father’s 
silver watch—they are only worth five or six roubles alto-
gether … but I value them. So what am I to do now? I do not 
want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking 
just now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we 
spoke of Dounia’s watch. It is the only thing of father’s left 
us. She would be ill if it were lost. You know what women 
are. So tell me what to do. I know I ought to have given 
notice at the police station, but would it not be better to 
go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter 
might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for 
it before dinner.’
‘Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,’ 
Razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement. ‘Well, 
how glad I am. Let us go at once. It is a couple of steps. We 
shall be sure to find him.’
 345‘Very well, let us go.’
‘And he will be very, very glad to make your acquain-
tance. I have often talked to him of you at different times. I 
was speaking of you yesterday. Let us go. So you knew the 
old woman? So that’s it! It is all turning out splendidly…. 
Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna …’
‘Sofya Semyonovna,’ corrected Raskolnikov. ‘Sofya 
Semyonovna, this is my friend Razumihin, and he is a good 
man.’
‘If you have to go now,’ Sonia was beginning, not looking 
at Razumihin at all, and still more embarrassed.
‘Let us go,’ decided Raskolnikov. ‘I will come to you to-
day, Sofya Semyonovna. Only tell me where you live.’
He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and 
avoided her eyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she 
did so. They all went out together.
‘Don’t you lock up?’ asked Razumihin, following him on 
to the stairs.
‘Never,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘I have been meaning to 
buy a lock for these two years. People are happy who have 
no need of locks,’ he said, laughing, to Sonia. They stood 
still in the gateway.
‘Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did 
you find me, by the way?’ he added, as though he wanted to 
say something quite different. He wanted to look at her soft 
clear eyes, but this was not easy.
‘Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.’
‘Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is 
your sister? Did I give her the address?’
 Crime and Punishment
346
‘Why, had you forgotten?’
‘No, I remember.’
‘I had heard my father speak of you … only I did not 
know your name, and he did not know it. And now I came 
… and as I had learnt your name, I asked to-day, ‘Where 
does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I did not know you had only a 
room too…. Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.’
She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away 
looking down, hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possi-
ble, to walk the twenty steps to the turning on the right and 
to be at last alone, and then moving rapidly along, looking 
at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to remember, to med-
itate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she felt 
anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new 
world was opening before her. She remembered suddenly 
that Raskolnikov meant to come to her that day, perhaps 
at once!
‘Only not to-day, please, not to-day!’ she kept muttering 
with a sinking heart, as though entreating someone, like a 
frightened child. ‘Mercy! to me … to that room … he will 
see … oh, dear!’
She was not capable at that instant of noticing an un-
known gentleman who was watching her and following at 
her heels. He had accompanied her from the gateway. At 
the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood 
still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was 
just passing, started on hearing Sonia’s words: ‘and I asked 
where Mr. Raskolnikov lived?’ He turned a rapid but atten-
tive look upon all three, especially upon Raskolnikov, to 
 347whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted the 
house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and try-
ing not to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as 
though waiting for something. He was waiting for Sonia; he 
saw that they were parting, and that Sonia was going home.
‘Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,’ he 
thought. ‘I must find out.’
At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw 
Sonia coming the same way, noticing nothing. She turned 
the corner. He followed her on the other side. After about 
fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook her and kept two 
or three yards behind her.
He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with 
broad high shoulders which made him look as though he 
stooped a little. He wore good and fashionable clothes, and 
looked like a gentleman of position. He carried a handsome 
cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each step; his 
gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face 
with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen 
in Petersburg. His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only 
touched here and there with grey, and his thick square beard 
was even lighter than his hair. His eyes were blue and had 
a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were crimson. He was a 
remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger 
than his years.
When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the 
only two persons on the pavement. He observed her dream-
iness and preoccupation. On reaching the house where she 
lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed her, seem-
 Crime and Punishment
348
ing rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the 
right corner. ‘Bah!’ muttered the unknown gentleman, and 
mounted the stairs behind her. Only then Sonia noticed 
him. She reached the third storey, turned down the pas-
sage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed in chalk, 
‘Kapernaumov, Tailor.’ ‘Bah!’ the stranger repeated again, 
wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next 
door, at No. 8. The doors were two or three yards apart.
‘You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,’ he said, looking at Sonia 
and laughing. ‘He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am 
staying close here at Madame Resslich’s. How odd!’ Sonia 
looked at him attentively.
‘We are neighbours,’ he went on gaily. ‘I only came to 
town the day before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.’
Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. 
She felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy.
*****
On the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously ex-
cited.
‘That’s capital, brother,’ he repeated several times, ‘and I 
am glad! I am glad!’
‘What are you glad about?’ Raskolnikov thought to him-
self.
‘I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, 
too. And … was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you 
were there?’
‘What a simple-hearted fool he is!’
‘When was it?’ Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. 
‘Two or three days before her death it must have been. But 
 349I am not going to redeem the things now,’ he put in with a 
sort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things. 
‘I’ve not more than a silver rouble left … after last night’s ac-
cursed delirium!’
He laid special emphasis on the delirium.
‘Yes, yes,’ Razumihin hastened to agree—with what was 
not clear. ‘Then that’s why you … were stuck … partly … 
you know in your delirium you were continually mention-
ing some rings or chains! Yes, yes … that’s clear, it’s all clear 
now.’
‘Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. 
Here this man will go to the stake for me, and I find him 
delighted at having it cleared up why I spoke of rings in my 
delirium! What a hold the idea must have on all of them!’
‘Shall we find him?’ he asked suddenly.
‘Oh, yes,’ Razumihin answered quickly. ‘He is a nice fel-
low, you will see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is 
a man of polished manners, but I mean clumsy in a differ-
ent sense. He is an intelligent fellow, very much so indeed, 
but he has his own range of ideas…. He is incredulous, scep-
tical, cynical … he likes to impose on people, or rather to 
make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method…. 
But he understands his work … thoroughly…. Last year he 
cleared up a case of murder in which the police had hardly a 
clue. He is very, very anxious to make your acquaintance!’
‘On what grounds is he so anxious?’
‘Oh, it’s not exactly … you see, since you’ve been ill I 
happen to have mentioned you several times…. So, when 
he heard about you … about your being a law student and 
 Crime and Punishment
350
not able to finish your studies, he said, ‘What a pity!’ And 
so I concluded … from everything together, not only that; 
yesterday Zametov … you know, Rodya, I talked some non-
sense on the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk 
… I am afraid, brother, of your exaggerating it, you see.’
‘What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are 
right,’ he said with a constrained smile.
‘Yes, yes…. That is, pooh, no! … But all that I said (and 
there was something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken 
nonsense.’
‘But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!’ Ras-
kolnikov cried with exaggerated irritability. It was partly 
assumed, however.
‘I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. 
One’s ashamed to speak of it.’
‘If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.’
Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and 
Raskolnikov perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, 
too, by what Razumihin had just said about Porfiry.
‘I shall have to pull a long face with him too,’ he thought, 
with a beating heart, and he turned white, ‘and do it natu-
rally, too. But the most natural thing would be to do nothing 
at all. Carefully do nothing at all! No, carefully would not 
be natural again…. Oh, well, we shall see how it turns out…. 
We shall see … directly. Is it a good thing to go or not? The 
butterfly flies to the light. My heart is beating, that’s what’s 
bad!’
‘In this grey house,’ said Razumihin.
‘The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was 
 351at the old hag’s flat yesterday … and asked about the blood? 
I must find that out instantly, as soon as I go in, find out 
from his face; otherwise … I’ll find out, if it’s my ruin.’
‘I say, brother,’ he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, 
with a sly smile, ‘I have been noticing all day that you seem 
to be curiously excited. Isn’t it so?’
‘Excited? Not a bit of it,’ said Razumihin, stung to the 
quick.
‘Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on 
your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, 
and you seemed to be writhing all the time. You kept jump-
ing up for nothing. One moment you were angry, and the 
next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even blushed; 
especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed 
awfully.’
‘Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?’
‘But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By 
Jove, there he’s blushing again.’
‘What a pig you are!’
‘But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, 
I’ll tell of you to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mother laugh, and 
someone else, too …’
‘Listen, listen, listen, this is serious…. What next, you 
fiend!’ Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold 
with horror. ‘What will you tell them? Come, brother … 
foo! what a pig you are!’
‘You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how 
it suits you; a Romeo over six foot high! And how you’ve 
washed to-day—you cleaned your nails, I declare. Eh? That’s 
 Crime and Punishment
352
something unheard of! Why, I do believe you’ve got poma-
tum on your hair! Bend down.’
‘Pig!’
Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain 
himself. So laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. 
This is what Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could 
be heard laughing as they came in, still guffawing in the 
passage.
‘Not a word here or I’ll … brain you!’ Razumihin whis-
pered furiously, seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.

## Chapter 5

R
askolnikov was already entering the room. He came in 
looking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to 
burst out laughing again. Behind him Razumihin strode in 
gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with 
an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face 
and whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and 
amply justified Raskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not 
waiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, 
who stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at 
them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparent-
ly making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a 
few words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner suc-
ceeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something 
when he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at 
Razumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled 
laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to 
restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumi-
hin received this ‘spontaneous’ mirth gave the whole scene 
the appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness. Razu-
mihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.
‘Fool! You fiend,’ he roared, waving his arm which at 
once struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on 
it. Everything was sent flying and crashing.
‘But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to 
 Crime and Punishment
354
the Crown,’ Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.
Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry 
Petrovitch’s, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right 
moment to put a natural end to it. Razumihin, completely 
put to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the 
glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned 
sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his 
back to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, 
seeing nothing. Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready 
to go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. 
Zametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the 
visitors’ entrance and was standing in expectation with a 
smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even 
it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov 
with a certain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected pres-
ence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.
‘I’ve got to think of that,’ he thought. ‘Excuse me, please,’ 
he began, affecting extreme embarrassment. ‘Raskolnikov.’
‘Not at all, very pleasant to see you … and how pleasantly 
you’ve come in…. Why, won’t he even say good-morning?’ 
Porfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin.
‘Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage 
with me. I only told him as we came along that he was like 
Romeo … and proved it. And that was all, I think!’
‘Pig!’ ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.
‘There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is 
so furious at the word,’ Porfiry laughed.
‘Oh, you sharp lawyer! … Damn you all!’ snapped Razu-
mihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went 
 355up to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing 
had happened. ‘That’ll do! We are all fools. To come to busi-
ness. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; 
in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make 
your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of 
business with you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? 
Have you met before? Have you known each other long?’
‘What does this mean?’ thought Raskolnikov uneasily.
Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.
‘Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,’ he said eas-
ily.
‘Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was 
begging me to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have 
sniffed each other out without me. Where is your tobacco?’
Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very 
clean linen, and trodden-down slippers. He was a man of 
about five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and 
clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short and had a large 
round head, particularly prominent at the back. His soft, 
round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish co-
lour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It 
would have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, 
which shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost 
white, blinking eyelashes. The expression of those eyes was 
strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish fig-
ure, and gave it something far more serious than could be 
guessed at first sight.
As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had 
a little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit 
 Crime and Punishment
356
down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, 
waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful 
and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and 
embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if 
what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little 
importance for such exceptional solemnity. But in brief and 
coherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clear-
ly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that 
he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry. Porfiry 
Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin, 
sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and im-
patiently, looking from one to the other every moment with 
rather excessive interest.
‘Fool,’ Raskolnikov swore to himself.
‘You have to give information to the police,’ Porfiry re-
plied, with a most businesslike air, ‘that having learnt of 
this incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the 
lawyer in charge of the case that such and such things be-
long to you, and that you desire to redeem them … or … but 
they will write to you.’
‘That’s just the point, that at the present moment,’ Ras-
kolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, ‘I am not 
quite in funds … and even this trifling sum is beyond me 
… I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the 
things are mine, and that when I have money….’
‘That’s no matter,’ answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving 
his explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, ‘but you 
can, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having 
been informed of the matter, and claiming such and such 
 357as your property, you beg …’
‘On an ordinary sheet of paper?’ Raskolnikov inter-
rupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the 
question.
‘Oh, the most ordinary,’ and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch 
looked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, 
as it were, winking at him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s 
fancy, for it all lasted but a moment. There was certainly 
something of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he 
winked at him, goodness knows why.
‘He knows,’ flashed through his mind like lightning.
‘Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,’ he went 
on, a little disconcerted, ‘the things are only worth five 
roubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those 
from whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was 
alarmed when I heard …’
‘That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned 
to Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who 
had pledges!’ Razumihin put in with obvious intention.
This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help 
glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black 
eyes, but immediately recollected himself.
‘You seem to be jeering at me, brother?’ he said to him, 
with a well- feigned irritability. ‘I dare say I do seem to you 
absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn’t think 
me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be 
anything but trash in my eyes. I told you just now that the 
silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the only thing 
left us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother 
 Crime and Punishment
358
is here,’ he turned suddenly to Porfiry, ‘and if she knew,’ he 
turned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his 
voice tremble, ‘that the watch was lost, she would be in de-
spair! You know what women are!’
‘Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the con-
trary!’ shouted Razumihin distressed.
‘Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?’ Raskol-
nikov asked himself in a tremor. ‘Why did I say that about 
women?’
‘Oh, your mother is with you?’ Porfiry Petrovitch in-
quired.
‘Yes.’
‘When did she come?’
‘Last night.’
Porfiry paused as though reflecting.
‘Your things would not in any case be lost,’ he went on 
calmly and coldly. ‘I have been expecting you here for some 
time.’
And as though that was a matter of no importance, he 
carefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruth-
lessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet. Raskolnikov 
shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, 
and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.
‘What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had 
pledges there?’ cried Razumihin.
Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.
‘Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up 
together, and on the paper your name was legibly written in 
pencil, together with the date on which you left them with 
 359her …’
‘How observant you are!’ Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, 
doing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but 
he failed, and suddenly added:
‘I say that because I suppose there were a great many 
pledges … that it must be difficult to remember them all…. 
But you remember them all so clearly, and … and …’
‘Stupid! Feeble!’ he thought. ‘Why did I add that?’
‘But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only 
one who hasn’t come forward,’ Porfiry answered with hard-
ly perceptible irony.
‘I haven’t been quite well.’
‘I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great 
distress about something. You look pale still.’
‘I am not pale at all…. No, I am quite well,’ Raskolnikov 
snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his 
tone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. ‘And 
in my anger I shall betray myself,’ flashed through his mind 
again. ‘Why are they torturing me?’
‘Not quite well!’ Razumihin caught him up. ‘What next! 
He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would 
you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he 
dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip 
and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious 
all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!’
‘Really delirious? You don’t say so!’ Porfiry shook his 
head in a womanish way.
‘Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it 
anyway,’ Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petro-
 Crime and Punishment
360
vitch did not seem to catch those strange words.
‘But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been de-
lirious?’ Razumihin got hot suddenly. ‘What did you go out 
for? What was the object of it? And why on the sly? Were 
you in your senses when you did it? Now that all danger is 
over I can speak plainly.’
‘I was awfully sick of them yesterday.’ Raskolnikov ad-
dressed Porfiry suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, 
‘I ran away from them to take lodgings where they wouldn’t 
find me, and took a lot of money with me. Mr. Zametov 
there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or delirious 
yesterday; settle our dispute.’
He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so 
hateful were his expression and his silence to him.
‘In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but 
you were extremely irritable,’ Zametov pronounced dryly.
‘And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,’ put in 
Porfiry Petrovitch, ‘that he met you very late last night in 
the lodging of a man who had been run over.’
‘And there,’ said Razumihin, ‘weren’t you mad then? You 
gave your last penny to the widow for the funeral. If you 
wanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three 
roubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-
five at once!’
‘Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know 
nothing of it? So that’s why I was liberal yesterday…. Mr. 
Zametov knows I’ve found a treasure! Excuse us, please, for 
disturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,’ he 
said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. ‘We 
 361are boring you, aren’t we?’
‘Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only 
you knew how you interest me! It’s interesting to look on 
and listen … and I am really glad you have come forward 
at last.’
‘But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,’ cried 
Razumihin.
‘Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. 
Wouldn’t you like … something more essential before tea?’
‘Get along with you!’
Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.
Raskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in ter-
rible exasperation.
‘The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care 
to stand on ceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at 
all, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me? 
So they don’t care to hide that they are tracking me like 
a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.’ He was shak-
ing with rage. ‘Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me 
like a cat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, 
but perhaps I won’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the 
whole truth in your ugly faces, and you’ll see how I despise 
you.’ He could hardly breathe. ‘And what if it’s only my fan-
cy? What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get 
angry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s all un-
intentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there 
is something about them…. It all might be said, but there 
is something. Why did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did 
Zametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in 
 Crime and Punishment
362
that tone? Yes, the tone…. Razumihin is sitting here, why 
does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does 
see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just 
now? Of course it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are 
they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Ei-
ther it’s ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude…. Is 
Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I foresaw 
he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s 
my first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits 
with his back to him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, 
over me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before 
we came. Do they know about the flat? If only they’d make 
haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it 
pass…. I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use 
afterwards…. Delirious, indeed … ha-ha-ha! He knows all 
about last night! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! 
The hag had written the date on in pencil! You are wrong, 
you won’t catch me! There are no facts … it’s all supposition! 
You produce facts! The flat even isn’t a fact but delirium. I 
know what to say to them…. Do they know about the flat? I 
won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my 
being angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! 
Perhaps that’s right; to play the invalid…. He is feeling me. 
He will try to catch me. Why did I come?’
All this flashed like lightning through his mind.
Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became sudden-
ly more jovial.
‘Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather…. 
And I am out of sorts altogether,’ he began in quite a differ-
 363ent tone, laughing to Razumihin.
‘Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most inter-
esting point. Who got the best of it?’
‘Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting ques-
tions, floated off into space.’
‘Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Wheth-
er there is such a thing as crime. I told you that we talked 
our heads off.’
‘What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,’ 
Raskolnikov answered casually.
‘The question wasn’t put quite like that,’ observed Por-
firy.
‘Not quite, that’s true,’ Razumihin agreed at once, get-
ting warm and hurried as usual. ‘Listen, Rodion, and tell us 
your opinion, I want to hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail 
with them and wanted you to help me. I told them you were 
coming…. It began with the socialist doctrine. You know 
their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality 
of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing 
more; no other causes admitted! …’
‘You are wrong there,’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was 
noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at Ra-
zumihin, which made him more excited than ever.
‘Nothing is admitted,’ Razumihin interrupted with heat.
‘I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Every-
thing with them is ‘the influence of environment,’ and 
nothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it follows 
that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at 
once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all 
 Crime and Punishment
364
men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature 
is not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to 
exist! They don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a 
historical living process, will become at last a normal soci-
ety, but they believe that a social system that has come out 
of some mathematical brain is going to organise all human-
ity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker 
than any living process! That’s why they instinctively dis-
like history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and 
they explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the 
living process of life; they don’t want a living soul! The living 
soul demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechan-
ics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! 
But what they want though it smells of death and can be 
made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is 
servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end to their re-
ducing everything to the building of walls and the planning 
of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery 
is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for 
the phalanstery—it wants life, it hasn’t completed its vital 
process, it’s too soon for the graveyard! You can’t skip over 
nature by logic. Logic presupposes three possibilities, but 
there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce it all to 
the question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the 
problem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about 
it. That’s the great thing, you mustn’t think! The whole se-
cret of life in two pages of print!’
‘Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!’ 
laughed Porfiry. ‘Can you imagine,’ he turned to Raskol-
 365nikov, ‘six people holding forth like that last night, in one 
room, with punch as a preliminary! No, brother, you are 
wrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I 
can assure you of that.’
‘Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty vio-
lates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?’
‘Well, strictly speaking, it did,’ Porfiry observed with 
noteworthy gravity; ‘a crime of that nature may be very well 
ascribed to the influence of environment.’
Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. ‘Oh, if you like,’ he 
roared. ‘I’ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very 
well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great’s being 
two hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, 
exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency! I 
undertake to! Will you bet on it?’
‘Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!’
‘He is always humbugging, confound him,’ cried Razu-
mihin, jumping up and gesticulating. ‘What’s the use of 
talking to you? He does all that on purpose; you don’t know 
him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make 
fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they 
were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. 
Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monas-
tery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it 
into his head to declare he was going to get married, that 
he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new 
clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There 
was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!’
‘Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the 
 Crime and Punishment
366
new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.’
‘Are you such a good dissembler?’ Raskolnikov asked 
carelessly.
‘You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall 
take you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All 
these questions about crime, environment, children, recall 
to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the 
time. ‘On Crime’ … or something of the sort, I forget the 
title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the Periodi-
cal Review. ’
‘My article? In the Periodical Review?’ Raskolnikov asked 
in astonishment. ‘I certainly did write an article upon a 
book six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it 
to the Weekly Review. ’
‘But it came out in the Periodical. ’
‘And the Weekly Review ceased to exist, so that’s why it 
wasn’t printed at the time.’
‘That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the Weekly Re-
view was amalgamated with the Periodical and so your 
article appeared two months ago in the latter. Didn’t you 
know?’
Raskolnikov had not known.
‘Why, you might get some money out of them for the 
article! What a strange person you are! You lead such a soli-
tary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you 
directly. It’s a fact, I assure you.’
‘Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!’ cried Ra-
zumihin. ‘I’ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for 
the number. Two months ago? What was the date? It doesn’t 
 367matter though, I will find it. Think of not telling us!’
‘How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only 
signed with an initial.’
‘I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the edi-
tor; I know him…. I was very much interested.’
‘I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal 
before and after the crime.’
‘Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime 
is always accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but 
… it was not that part of your article that interested me so 
much, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret 
to say you merely suggested without working it out clearly. 
There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain 
persons who can … that is, not precisely are able to, but 
have a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and 
crimes, and that the law is not for them.’
Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional 
distortion of his idea.
‘What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not 
because of the influence of environment?’ Razumihin in-
quired with some alarm even.
‘No, not exactly because of it,’ answered Porfiry. ‘In his 
article all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordi-
nary.’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no 
right to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are 
ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to commit 
any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because 
they are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mis-
taken?’
 Crime and Punishment
368
‘What do you mean? That can’t be right?’ Razumihin 
muttered in bewilderment.
Raskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and 
knew where they wanted to drive him. He decided to take 
up the challenge.
‘That wasn’t quite my contention,’ he began simply and 
modestly. ‘Yet I admit that you have stated it almost cor-
rectly; perhaps, if you like, perfectly so.’ (It almost gave 
him pleasure to admit this.) ‘The only difference is that I 
don’t contend that extraordinary people are always bound 
to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt 
whether such an argument could be published. I simply 
hinted that an ‘extraordinary’ man has the right … that 
is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his 
own conscience to overstep … certain obstacles, and only 
in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea 
(sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity). 
You say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it 
as clear as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want 
me to; very well. I maintain that if the discoveries of Ke-
pler and Newton could not have been made known except 
by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more 
men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have 
been in duty bound … to eliminate the dozen or the hun-
dred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to 
the whole of humanity. But it does not follow from that that 
Newton had a right to murder people right and left and to 
steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I main-
tain in my article that all … well, legislators and leaders of 
 369men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and 
so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very 
fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient 
one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred 
by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed ei-
ther, if that bloodshed—often of innocent persons fighting 
bravely in defence of ancient law—were of use to their cause. 
It’s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these 
benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible 
carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men 
a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving 
some new word, must from their very nature be criminals—
more or less, of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get 
out of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is 
what they can’t submit to, from their very nature again, and 
to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. You see 
that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The same 
thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. 
As for my division of people into ordinary and extraordi-
nary, I acknowledge that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t 
insist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading 
idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into 
two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, mate-
rial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who 
have the gift or the talent to utter a new word. There are, of 
course, innumerable sub- divisions, but the distinguishing 
features of both categories are fairly well marked. The first 
category, generally speaking, are men conservative in tem-
perament and law-abiding; they live under control and love 
 Crime and Punishment
370
to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be con-
trolled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing 
humiliating in it for them. The second category all trans-
gress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction 
according to their capacities. The crimes of these men are 
of course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in 
very varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake 
of the better. But if such a one is forced for the sake of his 
idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I 
maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction 
for wading through blood—that depends on the idea and 
its dimensions, note that. It’s only in that sense I speak of 
their right to crime in my article (you remember it began 
with the legal question). There’s no need for such anxiety, 
however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they 
punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so 
fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same 
masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next genera-
tion and worship them (more or less). The first category is 
always the man of the present, the second the man of the 
future. The first preserve the world and people it, the sec-
ond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has 
an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with 
me—and vive la guerre éternelle—till the New Jerusalem, 
of course!’
‘Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?’
‘I do,’ Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these 
words and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his 
eyes on one spot on the carpet.
 371‘And … and do you believe in God? Excuse my curios-
ity.’
‘I do,’ repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.
‘And … do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?’
‘I … I do. Why do you ask all this?’
‘You believe it literally?’
‘Literally.’
‘You don’t say so…. I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. 
But let us go back to the question; they are not always ex-
ecuted. Some, on the contrary …’
‘Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their 
ends in this life, and then …’
‘They begin executing other people?’
‘If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your 
remark is very witty.’
‘Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish 
those extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? Are 
there signs at their birth? I feel there ought to be more exac-
titude, more external definition. Excuse the natural anxiety 
of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they adopt 
a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear some-
thing, be branded in some way? For you know if confusion 
arises and a member of one category imagines that he be-
longs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate obstacles’ as you so 
happily expressed it, then …’
‘Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than 
the other.’
‘Thank you.’
‘No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only 
 Crime and Punishment
372
arise in the first category, that is among the ordinary people 
(as I perhaps unfortunately called them). In spite of their 
predisposition to obedience very many of them, through 
a playfulness of nature, sometimes vouchsafed even to the 
cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people, ‘destroy-
ers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and 
this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really new people are 
very often unobserved by them, or even despised as reac-
tionaries of grovelling tendencies. But I don’t think there 
is any considerable danger here, and you really need not 
be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course, they might 
have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away 
with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in 
fact, even this isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, 
for they are very conscientious: some perform this service 
for one another and others chastise themselves with their 
own hands…. They will impose various public acts of peni-
tence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying effect; 
in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about…. It’s a law of 
nature.’
‘Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on 
that score; but there’s another thing worries me. Tell me, 
please, are there many people who have the right to kill oth-
ers, these extraordinary people? I am ready to bow down to 
them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming if there 
are a great many of them, eh?’
‘Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,’ Raskolnikov 
went on in the same tone. ‘People with new ideas, people 
with the faintest capacity for saying something new are 
 373extremely few in number, extraordinarily so in fact. One 
thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these grades 
and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regu-
larity some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown 
at present, but I am convinced that it exists, and one day 
may become known. The vast mass of mankind is mere 
material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by 
some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of rac-
es and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one 
man out of a thousand with a spark of independence. One 
in ten thousand perhaps—I speak roughly, approximate-
ly—is born with some independence, and with still greater 
independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of ge-
nius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of 
humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand 
millions. In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which 
all this takes place. But there certainly is and must be a defi-
nite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.’
‘Why, are you both joking?’ Razumihin cried at last. 
‘There you sit, making fun of one another. Are you serious, 
Rodya?’
Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face 
and made no reply. And the unconcealed, persistent, ner-
vous, and discourteous sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange 
to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.
‘Well, brother, if you are really serious … You are right, 
of course, in saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve 
read and heard a thousand times already; but what is re-
ally original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my 
 Crime and Punishment
374
horror, is that you sanction bloodshed in the name of con-
science and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism…. 
That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that sanction 
of bloodshed by conscience is to my mind … more terrible 
than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed….’
‘You are quite right, it is more terrible,’ Porfiry agreed.
‘Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I 
shall read it. You can’t think that! I shall read it.’
‘All that is not in the article, there’s only a hint of it,’ said 
Raskolnikov.
‘Yes, yes.’ Porfiry couldn’t sit still. ‘Your attitude to crime 
is pretty clear to me now, but … excuse me for my imper-
tinence (I am really ashamed to be worrying you like this), 
you see, you’ve removed my anxiety as to the two grades 
getting mixed, but … there are various practical possi-
bilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth 
imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet—a future one 
of course—and suppose he begins to remove all obstacles…. 
He has some great enterprise before him and needs money 
for it … and tries to get it … do you see?’
Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskol-
nikov did not even raise his eyes to him.
‘I must admit,’ he went on calmly, ‘that such cases cer-
tainly must arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt 
to fall into that snare; young people especially.’
‘Yes, you see. Well then?’
‘What then?’ Raskolnikov smiled in reply; ‘that’s not my 
fault. So it is and so it always will be. He said just now (he 
nodded at Razumihin) that I sanction bloodshed. Society is 
 375too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal inves-
tigators, penal servitude. There’s no need to be uneasy. You 
have but to catch the thief.’
‘And what if we do catch him?’
‘Then he gets what he deserves.’
‘You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?’
‘Why do you care about that?’
‘Simply from humanity.’
‘If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That 
will be his punishment—as well as the prison.’
‘But the real geniuses,’ asked Razumihin frowning, ‘those 
who have the right to murder? Oughtn’t they to suffer at all 
even for the blood they’ve shed?’
‘Why the word ought? It’s not a matter of permission or 
prohibition. He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain 
and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence 
and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have 
great sadness on earth,’ he added dreamily, not in the tone 
of the conversation.
He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, 
and took his cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his 
manner at his entrance, and he felt this. Everyone got up.
‘Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,’ 
Porfiry Petrovitch began again, ‘but I can’t resist. Allow me 
one little question (I know I am troubling you). There is just 
one little notion I want to express, simply that I may not 
forget it.’
‘Very good, tell me your little notion,’ Raskolnikov stood 
waiting, pale and grave before him.
 Crime and Punishment
376
‘Well, you see … I really don’t know how to express it 
properly…. It’s a playful, psychological idea…. When you 
were writing your article, surely you couldn’t have helped, 
he-he! fancying yourself … just a little, an ‘extraordinary’ 
man, uttering a new word in your sense…. That’s so, isn’t 
it?’
‘Quite possibly,’ Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.
Razumihin made a movement.
‘And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly 
difficulties and hardship or for some service to humanity—
to overstep obstacles? … For instance, to rob and murder?’
And again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noise-
lessly just as before.
‘If I did I certainly should not tell you,’ Raskolnikov an-
swered with defiant and haughty contempt.
‘No, I was only interested on account of your article, from 
a literary point of view …’
‘Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!’ Raskolnikov 
thought with repulsion.
‘Allow me to observe,’ he answered dryly, ‘that I don’t 
consider myself a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any person-
age of that kind, and not being one of them I cannot tell you 
how I should act.’
‘Oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in 
Russia?’ Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.
Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation 
of his voice.
‘Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did 
for Alyona Ivanovna last week?’ Zametov blurted out from 
 377the corner.
Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intent-
ly at Porfiry. Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed 
before this to be noticing something. He looked angrily 
around. There was a minute of gloomy silence. Raskolnikov 
turned to go.
‘Are you going already?’ Porfiry said amiably, holding 
out his hand with excessive politeness. ‘Very, very glad of 
your acquaintance. As for your request, have no uneasiness, 
write just as I told you, or, better still, come to me there 
yourself in a day or two … to-morrow, indeed. I shall be 
there at eleven o’clock for certain. We’ll arrange it all; we’ll 
have a talk. As one of the last to be there you might perhaps 
be able to tell us something,’ he added with a most good-na-
tured expression.
‘You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?’ 
Raskolnikov asked sharply.
‘Oh, why? That’s not necessary for the present. You mis-
understand me. I lose no opportunity, you see, and … I’ve 
talked with all who had pledges…. I obtained evidence 
from some of them, and you are the last…. Yes, by the way,’ 
he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, ‘I just remember, 
what was I thinking of?’ he turned to Razumihin, ‘you were 
talking my ears off about that Nikolay … of course, I know, 
I know very well,’ he turned to Raskolnikov, ‘that the fellow 
is innocent, but what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmi-
tri too…. This is the point, this is all: when you went up the 
stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?’
‘Yes,’ answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensa-
 Crime and Punishment
378
tion at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said 
it.
‘Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, 
didn’t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, 
do you remember? two workmen or at least one of them? 
They were painting there, didn’t you notice them? It’s very, 
very important for them.’
‘Painters? No, I didn’t see them,’ Raskolnikov answered 
slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same 
instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with 
anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap 
lay and not to overlook anything. ‘No, I didn’t see them, and 
I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open…. But on the 
fourth storey’ (he had mastered the trap now and was tri-
umphant) ‘I remember now that someone was moving out 
of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna’s…. I remember … I 
remember it clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa 
and they squeezed me against the wall. But painters … no, 
I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I don’t 
think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.’
‘What do you mean?’ Razumihin shouted suddenly, as 
though he had reflected and realised. ‘Why, it was on the 
day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was 
there three days before? What are you asking?’
‘Foo! I have muddled it!’ Porfiry slapped himself on the 
forehead. ‘Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!’ 
he addressed Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. ‘It 
would be such a great thing for us to find out whether any-
one had seen them between seven and eight at the flat, so I 
 379fancied you could perhaps have told us something…. I quite 
muddled it.’
‘Then you should be more careful,’ Razumihin observed 
grimly.
The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petro-
vitch saw them to the door with excessive politeness.
They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for 
some steps they did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a 
deep breath.

## Chapter 6

‘I 
don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!’ repeated Razumihin, 
trying in perplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.
They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, 
where Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Dounia had been ex-
pecting them a long while. Razumihin kept stopping on the 
way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited by the 
very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly 
about it.
‘Don’t believe it, then!’ answered Raskolnikov, with a 
cold, careless smile. ‘You were noticing nothing as usual, 
but I was weighing every word.’
‘You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words 
… h’m … certainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, 
and still more that wretch Zametov! … You are right, there 
was something about him—but why? Why?’
‘He has changed his mind since last night.’
‘Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they 
would do their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so 
as to catch you afterwards…. But it was all impudent and 
careless.’
‘If they had had facts—I mean, real facts—or at least 
grounds for suspicion, then they would certainly have tried 
to hide their game, in the hope of getting more (they would 
have made a search long ago besides). But they have no facts, 
 381not one. It is all mirage—all ambiguous. Simply a floating 
idea. So they try to throw me out by impudence. And per-
haps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted it out 
in his vexation—or perhaps he has some plan … he seems 
an intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by 
pretending to know. They have a psychology of their own, 
brother. But it is loathsome explaining it all. Stop!’
‘And it’s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But … 
since we have spoken openly now (and it is an excellent 
thing that we have at last—I am glad) I will own now frank-
ly that I noticed it in them long ago, this idea. Of course 
the merest hint only—an insinuation—but why an insinu-
ation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If 
only you knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply 
because a poor student, unhinged by poverty and hypo-
chondria, on the eve of a severe delirious illness (note that), 
suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to speak to 
for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to 
face some wretched policemen and put up with their inso-
lence; and the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the 
I.O.U. presented by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty de-
grees Reaumur and a stifling atmosphere, a crowd of people, 
the talk about the murder of a person where he had been 
just before, and all that on an empty stomach—he might 
well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it 
all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in 
your place, Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit 
in their ugly faces, and spit a dozen times in all directions. 
I’d hit out in all directions, neatly too, and so I’d put an end 
 Crime and Punishment
382
to it. Damn them! Don’t be downhearted. It’s a shame!’
‘He really has put it well, though,’ Raskolnikov thought.
‘Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-mor-
row?’ he said with bitterness. ‘Must I really enter into 
explanations with them? I feel vexed as it is, that I conde-
scended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the restaurant….’
‘Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out 
of him, as one of the family: he must let me know the ins 
and outs of it all! And as for Zametov …’
‘At last he sees through him!’ thought Raskolnikov.
‘Stay!’ cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder 
again. ‘Stay! you were wrong. I have thought it out. You 
are wrong! How was that a trap? You say that the question 
about the workmen was a trap. But if you had done that 
could you have said you had seen them painting the flat … 
and the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen 
nothing, even if you had seen it. Who would own it against 
himself?’
‘If I had done that thing I should certainly have said that I 
had seen the workmen and the flat,’ Raskolnikov answered, 
with reluctance and obvious disgust.
‘But why speak against yourself?’
‘Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novic-
es deny everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so 
little developed and experienced, he will certainly try to ad-
mit all the external facts that can’t be avoided, but will seek 
other explanations of them, will introduce some special, 
unexpected turn, that will give them another significance 
and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon 
 383that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them 
to give an air of truth, and then make some explanation.’
‘But he would have told you at once that the workmen 
could not have been there two days before, and that there-
fore you must have been there on the day of the murder at 
eight o’clock. And so he would have caught you over a de-
tail.’
‘Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not 
have time to reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the 
most likely answer, and so would forget that the workmen 
could not have been there two days before.’
‘But how could you forget it?’
‘Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever peo-
ple are most easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the 
less he suspects that he will be caught in a simple thing. The 
more cunning a man is, the simpler the trap he must be 
caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you think….’
‘He is a knave then, if that is so!’
Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very mo-
ment, he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, 
and the eagerness with which he had made this explanation, 
though he had kept up all the preceding conversation with 
gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive, from necessity.
‘I am getting a relish for certain aspects!’ he thought to 
himself. But almost at the same instant he became suddenly 
uneasy, as though an unexpected and alarming idea had oc-
curred to him. His uneasiness kept on increasing. They had 
just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.
‘Go in alone!’ said Raskolnikov suddenly. ‘I will be back 
 Crime and Punishment
384
directly.’
‘Where are you going? Why, we are just here.’
‘I can’t help it…. I will come in half an hour. Tell them.’
‘Say what you like, I will come with you.’
‘You, too, want to torture me!’ he screamed, with such 
bitter irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumi-
hin’s hands dropped. He stood for some time on the steps, 
looking gloomily at Raskolnikov striding rapidly away in 
the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting his teeth and 
clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry like 
a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure 
Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their 
long absence.
When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with 
sweat and he was breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the 
stairs, walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened 
the latch. Then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner, 
to that hole under the paper where he had put the things; 
put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the 
hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, 
he got up and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the 
steps of Bakaleyev’s, he suddenly fancied that something, a 
chain, a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been 
wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it, might 
somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and 
then might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evi-
dence against him.
He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, hu-
miliated, half senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his 
 385cap at last and went quietly out of the room. His ideas were 
all tangled. He went dreamily through the gateway.
‘Here he is himself,’ shouted a loud voice.
He raised his head.
The porter was standing at the door of his little room 
and was pointing him out to a short man who looked like 
an artisan, wearing a long coat and a waistcoat, and look-
ing at a distance remarkably like a woman. He stooped, and 
his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled 
flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat 
and they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.
‘What is it?’ Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.
The man stole a look at him from under his brows and 
he looked at him attentively, deliberately; then he turned 
slowly and went out of the gate into the street without say-
ing a word.
‘What is it?’ cried Raskolnikov.
‘Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, 
mentioned your name and whom you lodged with. I saw 
you coming and pointed you out and he went away. It’s fun-
ny.’
The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, 
and after wondering for a moment he turned and went back 
to his room.
Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught 
sight of him walking along the other side of the street with 
the same even, deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the 
ground, as though in meditation. He soon overtook him, 
but for some time walked behind him. At last, moving on 
 Crime and Punishment
386
to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man noticed 
him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes 
again; and so they walked for a minute side by side without 
uttering a word.
‘You were inquiring for me … of the porter?’ Raskolnikov 
said at last, but in a curiously quiet voice.
The man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. 
Again they were both silent.
‘Why do you … come and ask for me … and say noth-
ing…. What’s the meaning of it?’
Raskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to ar-
ticulate the words clearly.
The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy 
sinister look at Raskolnikov.
‘Murderer!’ he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and dis-
tinct voice.
Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt 
suddenly weak, a cold shiver ran down his spine, and his 
heart seemed to stand still for a moment, then suddenly be-
gan throbbing as though it were set free. So they walked for 
about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.
The man did not look at him.
‘What do you mean … what is…. Who is a murderer?’ 
muttered Raskolnikov hardly audibly.
‘You are a murderer,’ the man answered still more articu-
lately and emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, 
and again he looked straight into Raskolnikov’s pale face 
and stricken eyes.
They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned 
 387to the left without looking behind him. Raskolnikov re-
mained standing, gazing after him. He saw him turn round 
fifty paces away and look back at him still standing there. 
Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that he 
was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and tri-
umph.
With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskol-
nikov made his way back to his little garret, feeling chilled 
all over. He took off his cap and put it on the table, and 
for ten minutes he stood without moving. Then he sank 
exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he 
stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.
He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of 
thoughts, some images without order or coherence floated 
before his mind—faces of people he had seen in his child-
hood or met somewhere once, whom he would never have 
recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table in 
a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of 
cigars in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, 
a back staircase quite dark, all sloppy with dirty water and 
strewn with egg-shells, and the Sunday bells floating in from 
somewhere…. The images followed one another, whirling 
like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried to clutch 
at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression 
within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was 
even pleasant…. The slight shivering still persisted, but that 
too was an almost pleasant sensation.
He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed 
his eyes and pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the 
 Crime and Punishment
388
door and stood for some time in the doorway as though 
hesitating, then he stepped softly into the room and went 
cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s whis-
per:
‘Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his din-
ner later.’
‘Quite so,’ answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully 
and closed the door. Another half-hour passed. Raskol-
nikov opened his eyes, turned on his back again, clasping 
his hands behind his head.
‘Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? 
Where was he, what did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. 
Where was he then? And from where did he see? Why has 
he only now sprung out of the earth? And how could he see? 
Is it possible? Hm …’ continued Raskolnikov, turning cold 
and shivering, ‘and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the 
door—was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal 
line and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly 
flew by and saw it! Is it possible?’ He felt with sudden loath-
ing how weak, how physically weak he had become. ‘I ought 
to have known it,’ he thought with a bitter smile. ‘And how 
dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take 
up an axe and shed blood! I ought to have known before-
hand…. Ah, but I did know!’ he whispered in despair. At 
times he came to a standstill at some thought.
‘No, those men are not made so. The real Master to whom 
all is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, 
forgets an army in Egypt, wastes half a million men in the 
Moscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna. And al-
 389tars are set up to him after his death, and so all is permitted. 
No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but of bronze!’
One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Na-
poleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old 
woman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed—it’s 
a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest! How can they 
digest it! It’s too inartistic. ‘A Napoleon creep under an old 
woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!’
At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of 
feverish excitement. ‘The old woman is of no consequence,’ 
he thought, hotly and incoherently. ‘The old woman was a 
mistake perhaps, but she is not what matters! The old wom-
an was only an illness…. I was in a hurry to overstep…. I 
didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the prin-
ciple, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side…. I was 
only capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable 
of that … Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abus-
ing the socialists? They are industrious, commercial people; 
‘the happiness of all’ is their case. No, life is only given to 
me once and I shall never have it again; I don’t want to wait 
for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself, or else better 
not live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother starving, 
keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the ‘hap-
piness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness 
of all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let 
me slip? I only live once, I too want…. Ech, I am an æsthetic 
louse and nothing more,’ he added suddenly, laughing like a 
madman. ‘Yes, I am certainly a louse,’ he went on, clutching 
at the idea, gloating over it and playing with it with vindic-
 Crime and Punishment
390
tive pleasure. ‘In the first place, because I can reason that I 
am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been 
troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that 
not for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a 
grand and noble object— ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed 
at carrying it out as justly as possible, weighing, measuring 
and calculating. Of all the lice I picked out the most useless 
one and proposed to take from her only as much as I needed 
for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have 
gone to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And 
what shows that I am utterly a louse,’ he added, grinding his 
teeth, ‘is that I am perhaps viler and more loathsome than 
the louse I killed, and I felt beforehand that I should tell my-
self so after killing her. Can anything be compared with the 
horror of that? The vulgarity! The abjectness! I understand 
the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed: Allah commands 
and ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is right, 
he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows 
up the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! 
It’s for you to obey, trembling creation, and not to have de-
sires for that’s not for you! … I shall never, never forgive the 
old woman!’
His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were 
parched, his eyes were fixed on the ceiling.
‘Mother, sister—how I loved them! Why do I hate them 
now? Yes, I hate them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I 
can’t bear them near me…. I went up to my mother and 
kissed her, I remember…. To embrace her and think if she 
only knew … shall I tell her then? That’s just what I might 
 391do…. She must be the same as I am,’ he added, straining 
himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. ‘Ah, 
how I hate the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again 
if she came to life! Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in? 
… It’s strange though, why is it I scarcely ever think of her, 
as though I hadn’t killed her? Lizaveta! Sonia! Poor gentle 
things, with gentle eyes…. Dear women! Why don’t they 
weep? Why don’t they moan? They give up everything … 
their eyes are soft and gentle…. Sonia, Sonia! Gentle So-
nia!’
He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that 
he didn’t remember how he got into the street. It was late 
evening. The twilight had fallen and the full moon was 
shining more and more brightly; but there was a peculiar 
breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in 
the street; workmen and business people were making their 
way home; other people had come out for a walk; there was 
a smell of mortar, dust and stagnant water. Raskolnikov 
walked along, mournful and anxious; he was distinctly 
aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do 
something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Sud-
denly he stood still and saw a man standing on the other 
side of the street, beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, 
but at once the man turned and walked away with his head 
hanging, as though he had made no sign to him. ‘Stay, did 
he really beckon?’ Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried to 
overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised 
him and was frightened; it was the same man with stooping 
shoulders in the long coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a

distance; his heart was beating; they went down a turning; 
the man still did not look round. ‘Does he know I am fol-
lowing him?’ thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the 
gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate 
and looked in to see whether he would look round and sign 
to him. In the court-yard the man did turn round and again 
seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at once followed him 
into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have gone 
up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He 
heard slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase 
seemed strangely familiar. He reached the window on the 
first floor; the moon shone through the panes with a melan-
choly and mysterious light; then he reached the second floor. 
Bah! this is the flat where the painters were at work … but 
how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps of the 
man above had died away. ‘So he must have stopped or hid-
den somewhere.’ He reached the third storey, should he go 
on? There was a stillness that was dreadful…. But he went 
on. The sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened 
him. How dark it was! The man must be hiding in some cor-
ner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he hesitated 
and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as 
though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe 
into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight. Every-
thing there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the 
yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames. A huge, round, 
copper-red moon looked in at the windows. ‘It’s the moon 
that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,’ thought Ras-
kolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the 
 393more silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, 
till it was painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he 
heard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splin-
ter and all was still again. A fly flew up suddenly and struck 
the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At that moment he 
noticed in the corner between the window and the little 
cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. ‘Why 
is that cloak here?’ he thought, ‘it wasn’t there before….’ He 
went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding 
behind it. He cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on 
a chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he 
couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over her. ‘She 
is afraid,’ he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the 
noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. 
But strange to say she did not stir, as though she were made 
of wood. He was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to 
look at her; but she, too, bent her head lower. He bent right 
down to the ground and peeped up into her face from be-
low, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old woman 
was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, 
doing her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he 
fancied that the door from the bedroom was opened a little 
and that there was laughter and whispering within. He was 
overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the old woman 
on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe 
the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder 
and the old woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was 
rushing away, but the passage was full of people, the doors 
of the flats stood open and on the landing, on the stairs

and everywhere below there were people, rows of heads, 
all looking, but huddled together in silence and expecta-
tion. Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to 
the spot, they would not move…. He tried to scream and 
woke up.
He drew a deep breath—but his dream seemed strangely 
to persist: his door was flung open and a man whom he had 
never seen stood in the doorway watching him intently.
Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly 
closed them again. He lay on his back without stirring.
‘Is it still a dream?’ he wondered and again raised his 
eyelids hardly perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the 
same place, still watching him.
He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing 
the door after him, went up to the table, paused a moment, 
still keeping his eyes on Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated 
himself on the chair by the sofa; he put his hat on the floor 
beside him and leaned his hands on his cane and his chin 
on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait 
indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his 
stolen glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a 
full, fair, almost whitish beard.
Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to 
get dusk. There was complete stillness in the room. Not a 
sound came from the stairs. Only a big fly buzzed and flut-
tered against the window pane. It was unbearable at last. 
Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.
‘Come, tell me what you want.’
‘I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,’ the 
 395stranger answered oddly, laughing calmly. ‘Arkady Ivano-
vitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to introduce myself….’
