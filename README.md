# Generative AI Cogent Lab

This repository contains the necessary code and detailed instructions for setting up a Python environment dedicated to the Generative AI tasks at Cogent Lab.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the setup of your development environment to run the Jupyter Notebook for Generative AI tasks.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Anaconda** installed on your system. Anaconda is crucial as it simplifies package management and deployment.

### Setup Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Generative_AI_cogent_lab.git

   
Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**

Change to the project directory with:

cd generative_ai_task_cogentlab


3. **Create Conda Environment**

Create a new conda environment. Replace `'myenv'` with your preferred environment name:

conda create --name myenv python=3.8

4. **Activate Conda Environment**

Activate the newly created conda environment by running:

conda activate myenv


5. **Install Jupyter Notebook**

Install Jupyter Notebook within the conda environment:


conda install jupyter


### Run Jupyter Notebook

- To start Jupyter Notebook, simply run:


jupyter notebook


This command will launch the Jupyter Notebook interface in your default web browser where you can open and run notebook files.
